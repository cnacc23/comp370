1. Refactoring is recognizing code without changing its functionality. 
Examples: 
    a. changing a variable name
    b. changing the contract of a function 
    c. changing the data type being used in a particular instance 

2. Coding goes through natural phases of 'messiness' throughout a data science project because of all the underlying parts of the project. 
The more underlying components, the more exploration and different approaches to try out. 

3. Three techniques for creating more modular code are breaking code into functions, building classes and using function inputs as specific code arguments.
