I ran the Eugene Marathon in the spring in 3:58:49, so I started with a decent base.  My goal for a fall marathon was to really push myself... I say this because most marathons I've run, I've ended the race feeling 'good'.  I would basically just run at a pace that felt 'comfortable' and try to push through the fatigue that would ultimately hit later in the race.  Through this forum and friends, I've since learned that the marathon is still a race :) and that your pace should reflect that.... races are not 'comfortable' or easy.  I went into this training block and this race with that mindset.  I never really had a true time goal in mind... I just wanted to push myself to the edge of my fitness and see what would happen.\n\nI hired a coach, upped my mileage, ran mostly 'easy' runs, and had a dedicated track/speed session each week.  I peaked at 50 miles (up from 40ish in my last block) and had 8 weeks that surpassed the 40-mile threshold.  My typical week was as follows:\n\nMonday: Medium Long Run (ranging from 6-12 miles depending where I was in the training block) around a 9:45-10:15min/mile pace + lower body strength\n\nTuesday: 4-6 mile recovery run (10:30-11:00 min/mile pace)\n\nWednesday: full body strength\n\nThursday: 8-mile quality workout (typically at the track) - this would consist of a 1-2 mile warm up/cool down and about 5 miles of speed work\n\nFriday: 3-4 mile recovery run (10:30-11:00 min/mile pace)\n\nSaturday: Long run - I ultimately ran 3 20-milers and 1 22-miler.  2 of the 3 20-milers had pace work.  All other long runs were run between a 9:55-10:30 min/mile\n\n# Pre-Race\n\nI had a call with my coach on Tuesday before the race and he hit me with a race plan that had me finishing at 3:44:40.  Sub-3:45 never really crossed my mind until a few weeks before taper.  I had a very strong 20-mile workout.  My coach felt confident in 3:45. I, on the other hand, didn't think that would be possible and wanted to shoot for a 3:50.  That said, my A goal was to really push myself... I decided to trust my coach and my training and committed to the 3:45 game plan.  WILD!  At this point, I still couldn't comprehend how running a majority of my training miles at a 10:00min/mile or slower would somehow translate into 26.2 miles at an 8:33 pace.\n\n# Race\n\nThe plan was to run the first three miles 20-30 seconds slower than goal pace (8:33ish).  By mile 4 I was to settle into goal pace.  This went relatively according to plan, although miles 2 and 3 were a little quicker than expected.  I used miles 4-10 to really settle into a rhythm.  My coach told me that these miles would dictate the rest of the race... if goal pace felt too hard and my body felt more comfortable running an 8:45, then that was okay and this would be the point in the race where I'd make that decision.  I'll be honest, the pace didn't feel super comfortable and around mile 7 I gave myself permission to slow down... that said, the miles kept ticking by and I kept hitting goal pace.  By the time I hit mile 11 I had mentally committed to running 8:33's and just seeing what happened.  \n\nAt mile 12 I hit a water stop that was fairly understaffed.  I ultimately had to STOP and pick up water at a table.  You know how your legs feel when you end a long run and they start to seize up?  This happened to me at the water stop.... at mile 12.  My legs just felt heavy and tired.  At this point, I thought I was in for a rude awakening for the rest of the race.  Oddly enough, my legs never really got more tired as the race went on?  The level of fatigue I felt at mile 12 stayed with me throughout, but didn't get much worse.  The next few miles were a bit of a blur.  When I hit mile 16, I told myself that I just needed to 'do my job' and get to mile 20.\n\nWhen I hit mile 20, that's when mantra's really helped.  There was carnage all around with people walking and cramping up.  I kept my head down and told myself \"when it hurts, push  harder\" - I had started to pick up the pace a tinnnnny bit.  Strangely, 8:35's were hurting, but 8:25's-8:30's felt a bit easier... almost like it was the natural rhythm my body wanted to run.  While my legs didn't \"hurt\" I was definitely starting to feel the overall fatigue.\n\nI saw my husband and friend at mile 23.5 and this gave me SUCH a mental boost.  Seeing them gave me newfound energy and really helped me pick up the pace.  I saw them again at mile 25 and the same thing happened.  It wasn't until mile 25 when I realized that I could possibly break 3:45.  At this point, I had just shy of 10 minutes to run 1.2 miles.  Anything can happen that late in the game, so I cautiously picked up the pace even more.  I caught up with the 3:45 pacer at mile 25.5 (who I started behind) and asked if he was on pace.  He said he was so I kept at it.  I rounded the final corners and gave it a bit of a sprint (although looking at the video my \"sprint\" was definitely more of a \"plod\")... I stopped my watch and honestly didn't look at it.  I immediately found my husband and he told me my finish time... 3:44:09.  I couldn't believe it!  I still can't believe it.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading.  I wanted to write this recap for those who doubt that 'running easy' a majority of the time can lead to faster race times.  I'm proof of it :)\n\n", "author_fullname": "t2_x233t81td", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Indianapolis Monumental Marathon - Training 'easy' to run

My typical week was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monday: Medium Long Run (ranging from 6-12 miles depending where I was in the training block) around a 9:45-10:15min/mile pace + lower body strength&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuesday: 4-6 mile recovery run (10:30-11:00 min/mile pace)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday: full body strength&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thursday: 8-mile quality workout (typically at the track) - this would consist of a 1-2 mile warm up/cool down and about 5 miles of speed work&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday: 3-4 mile recovery run (10:30-11:00 min/mile pace)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday: Long run - I ultimately ran 3 20-milers and 1 22-miler.  2 of the 3 20-milers had pace work.  All other long runs were run between a 9:55-10:30 min/mile&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Pre-Race&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a call with my coach on Tuesday before the race and he hit me with a race plan that had me finishing at 3:44:40.  Sub-3:45 never really crossed my mind until a few weeks before taper.  I had a very strong 20-mile workout.  My coach felt confident in 3:45. I, on the other hand, didn&amp;#39;t think that would be possible and wanted to shoot for a 3:50.  That said, my A goal was to really push myself... I decided to trust my coach and my training and committed to the 3:45 game plan.  WILD!  At this point, I still couldn&amp;#39;t comprehend how running a majority of my training miles at a 10:00min/mile or slower would somehow translate into 26.2 miles at an 8:33 pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Race&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plan was to run the first three miles 20-30 seconds slower than goal pace (8:33ish).  By mile 4 I was to settle into goal pace.  This went relatively according to plan, although miles 2 and 3 were a little quicker than expected.  I used miles 4-10 to really settle into a rhythm.  My coach told me that these miles would dictate the rest of the race... if goal pace felt too hard and my body felt more comfortable running an 8:45, then that was okay and this would be the point in the race where I&amp;#39;d make that decision.  I&amp;#39;ll be honest, the pace didn&amp;#39;t feel super comfortable and around mile 7 I gave myself permission to slow down... that said, the miles kept ticking by and I kept hitting goal pace.  By the time I hit mile 11 I had mentally committed to running 8:33&amp;#39;s and just seeing what happened.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At mile 12 I hit a water stop that was fairly understaffed.  I ultimately had to STOP and pick up water at a table.  You know how your legs feel when you end a long run and they start to seize up?  This happened to me at the water stop.... at mile 12.  My legs just felt heavy and tired.  At this point, I thought I was in for a rude awakening for the rest of the race.  Oddly enough, my legs never really got more tired as the race went on?  The level of fatigue I felt at mile 12 stayed with me throughout, but didn&amp;#39;t get much worse.  The next few miles were a bit of a blur.  When I hit mile 16, I told myself that I just needed to &amp;#39;do my job&amp;#39; and get to mile 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I hit mile 20, that&amp;#39;s when mantra&amp;#39;s really helped.  There was carnage all around with people walking and cramping up.  I kept my head down and told myself &amp;quot;when it hurts, push  harder&amp;quot; - I had started to pick up the pace a tinnnnny bit.  Strangely, 8:35&amp;#39;s were hurting, but 8:25&amp;#39;s-8:30&amp;#39;s felt a bit easier... almost like it was the natural rhythm my body wanted to run.  While my legs didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;hurt&amp;quot; I was definitely starting to feel the overall fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw my husband and friend at mile 23.5 and this gave me SUCH a mental boost.  Seeing them gave me newfound energy and really helped me pick up the pace.  I saw them again at mile 25 and the same thing happened.  It wasn&amp;#39;t until mile 25 when I realized that I could possibly break 3:45.  At this point, I had just shy of 10 minutes to run 1.2 miles.  Anything can happen that late in the game, so I cautiously picked up the pace even more.  I caught up with the 3:45 pacer at mile 25.5 (who I started behind) and asked if he was on pace.  He said he was so I kept at it.  I rounded the final corners and gave it a bit of a sprint (although looking at the video my &amp;quot;sprint&amp;quot; was definitely more of a &amp;quot;plod&amp;quot;)... I stopped my watch and honestly didn&amp;#39;t look at it.  I immediately found my husband and he told me my finish time... 3:44:09.  I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it!  I still can&amp;#39;t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve made it this far, thanks for reading.  I wanted to write this recap for those who doubt that &amp;#39;running easy&amp;#39; a majority of the time can lead to faster race times.  I&amp;#39;m proof of it :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "941b9770-3f38-11e3-b90c-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0dd3bb", "id": "1gowhkc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Relevant-Cow60", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 16, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/running/comments/1gowhkc/indianapolis_monumental_marathon_training_easy_to/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1gowhkc/indianapolis_monumental_marathon_training_easy_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3688140, "created_utc": 1731343129.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "running", "selftext": "\\### Race Information\n\n\\* \\*\\*Name:\\*\\* Madison Marathon\n\n\\* \\*\\*Date:\\*\\* November 10, 2024\n\n\\* \\*\\*Distance:\\*\\* 26.2 miles\n\n\\* \\*\\*Location:\\*\\* Madison, Wisconsin\n\n\\* \\*\\*Website:\\*\\* [https://madisonmarathon.org/races/](https://madisonmarathon.org/races/)\n\n\\* \\*\\*Time:\\*\\* 4:48:45\n\n\\### Goals\n\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n\n|------|-------------|------------|\n\n| A | Sub 4:40 | \\*No\\* |\n\n| B | Sub 5:00 | \\*Yes\\* |\n\n| C | Finish | \\*Yes\\* |\n\n\\### Splits\n\n| Mile | Time |\n\n|------|------|\n\n| 1 | 10:21\n\n| 2 | 10:36\n\n| 3 | 10:29\n\n| 4 | 10:31\n\n| 5 | 10:41\n\n| 6 | 10:52\n\n| 7 | 10:52\n\n| 8 | 10:19\n\n| 9 | 10:39\n\n| 10 | 10:21\n\n| 11 | 10:29\n\n| 12 | 10:19\n\n| 13 | 10:14\n\n| 14 | 10:24\n\n| 15 | 10:24\n\n| 16 | 10:19\n\n| 17 | 10:34\n\n| 18 | 10:26\n\n| 19 | 11:00\n\n| 20 | 11:11\n\n| 21 | 11:19\n\n| 22 | 11:52\n\n| 23 | 12:22\n\n| 24 | 12:02\n\n| 25 | 12:08\n\n| 26 | 12:46\n\n| 27 | 4:35\n\n\\### Training\n\nI (30F) started running during the pandemic, beginning from a place of not even being able to run one mile. I worked my way up to a half marathon in fall 2022 (2:18). I really wanted to run sub-2, despite being nowhere near sub-2 shape, and ended up going out way too fast trying to catch the 2 hour pacers. I spent the second half of the race on the phone with my husband crying and begging him to tell me not to quit. A lot of lessons learned from that experience lol. In fall 2023, I spectated the Chicago Marathon with a friend, and we decided we would run it the next year (fall 2024). I decided to do another half in the spring of 2024 as a buildup to the marathon and managed a PR of 2:11, despite run/walking the last three miles because I was very over it mentally: better than my first half, but I was still obsessing about time rather than having fun. I knew my main goal for the marathon needed to be just to have fun and finish and that whatever pace I decided to go at needed to be reasonable and in accordance with my fitness. I didn't follow a formal training plan but pulled from a lot of sources: Jack Daniels, Hal Higdon, and my Garmin DSWs. I prioritized building a base of 30-35 mpw and getting my weekly long run in. I averaged 5-6 runs per week, with at least one session of intervals or a threshold run each week and a few tempo miles during my long runs. I was feeling pretty good until I got COVID about a month before the race. My husband has Long-COVID, so I know first-hand how dangerous the disease can be, especially when mixed with intense exercise. My symptoms were very mild, but I still took an entire week off from running, costing me my two longest runs (including my only 20-miler) and my peak week of training. I decided I didn't feel comfortable attempting my first marathon so soon after COVID and with my longest run being 18 miles five weeks out, so I got a note from my doctor to refund my registration and decided to do the Madison Marathon instead since it was a month later and would give me a chance to get in a few more weeks of solid training. Of course, I researched the Madison Marathon AFTER already registering and realized that it's incredibly hilly. Rather than freak out though, I decided to hit as many hills as possible in the few weeks of training I had left, even squeezing in a little more elevation during my 20 mile run than would be in the race overall. I felt FANTASTIC. Even better than I did a month out from Chicago. I felt really strong and prepared going into my taper.\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nI started increasing my carb intake during race week and hydrating like crazy. I prioritized sleep and baths and foam rolling, as much recovery as I could. (I was a little nervous about working the polls the Tuesday before the race, but it didn't seem to mess with my recovery too bad.) My husband and I drove to Madison (a little over an hour) the day before the race, and I hit up the expo. I gotta say, this was one of the best organized and well executed races I've attended! They got through a line of probably 1,000 people very quickly and efficiently. I was super impressed. (The race itself was also very well organized.) I got my bib and shirt (AWESOME shirts, too! Lightweight long-sleeve tech shirts in a beautiful blue color. The women's shirts are fitted). Then I did a super easy two mile shakeout before walking to an Italian restaurant for dinner with my husband. (We found a hotel room right by the Capitol, so everything, including the start line, was super close!) I ordered pasta and meatballs for dinner, and we were back to the hotel in bed by 7:00. I didn't sleep the greatest, but I didn't feel tired in the morning. I got up around 4:30, had some oatmeal with peanut butter and a banana, a glass of tailwind, and did some warmup stretches before heading to the start line around 6:30 (Race started at 7:00). I found the 4:40 pace group (which, based on my training, seemed like a conservative pace) and quickly made friends with the people around me. I had a UCAN Edge just before we took off.\n\n\\### Race\n\nOverall, the race was AMAZING. The weather at the start was PERFECT: 50 degrees and overcast, which I was grateful for because Madison has a history of being cold and windy and sometimes even snowy. The energy was great. They had us start in waves, which was awesome! Really minimized bobbing and weaving and kept the course from being too crowded. My only complaint is that the pacers were going way too fast. We should have been averaging 10:40 miles, but, as you can see from my splits, we were sometimes dropping closer to 10:20. I thought maybe they were banking time for the hills, but they didn't seem to slow going up them. I was a little nervous, but the effort felt easy, so I decided to stay with the group. My heart rate was where I wanted it to be, and I was dancing through all the aid stations (another shoutout to the Madison race organizers: SO MANY AID STATIONS! And they were all fully stocked with Gatorade, water, and Gu. And each one had a few portapotties). My nutrition was working really well. I did one Clif Bloks chew every 15 minutes, a salt chew every 30, a UCAN Edge every 45, sip on Tailwind from my personal bottle, and grab water at every aid station. (Complicated, I know, but it gives me something to focus on, and I like the mix of chewing vs. slurping lol.) I saw my husband just before halfway, and it lifted my spirits even more. I was having a blast! The people in my pace group were amazing, and we had so much fun chatting and laughing together. I felt really really good until about mile 16, when I started noticing some pain in my knees. I was a little surprised given that it's usually my hips that bug me. I thought maybe it would work itself out, but by mile 18, the pain was strong and persistent, and I knew I would need to start walking the hills or I would become too hurt to finish. I was never dejected though. I put on music for the first time and just focused on moving forward. I trusted my training and knew I could finish. At mile 22, a woman who had started with our pace group and slowed around mile 14 caught up to me and encouraged me to finish with her, promising we could walk all the hills together. She was amazing! I couldn't have done it without her. I was in so much pain at that point, but we got through that last few miles together. It started pouring down rain, but I didn't care. I was about to finish a marathon! The biggest hill was right at the end going up toward the Capitol. Once we topped it, I let myself run (hobble) to the finish, not realizing there was one final tiny uphill push. A course worker on a bike rode beside me, looking extremely concerned but encouraging me to keep going. I crossed the finish line in 4:48 with a huge smile on my face. I ran a freaking marathon! And more importantly, I had fun while doing it! Despite the pain and having to walk the hills the last few miles, I had an absolute blast.\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nAfter crossing the finish line, I immediately grabbed a baked potato from the potato bar (again, Madison Marathon knows what's up!), and my husband and our mutual friend stood and watched me while I sat on a bench eating the thing in the pouring rain lol. After some sustenance, I walked (hobbled) with my husband to a coffeeshop for a warm drink and some shelter, just smiling from ear to ear. I couldn't believe how much fun I had had. While Chicago would have been great, I really think Madison was a perfect first marathon. Well-organized, a beautiful (albeit, hilly) course, great energy, and the perfect size crowd, imo. My legs are a little less stiff today, and I thankfully don't think my knees are injured, just really, really sore. This will definitely not be my last marathon, and I learned a lot from the experience. I think being undertrained is what got to me. I definitely plan to build up my base even more, adding more weekly mileage overall and to do even more strength training. I would also be curious to see how I do on a course that isn't quite so hilly, as I wonder if that also contributed to the issues with my knees. Most importantly, I learned that I have a much better time when I don't let myself be so dictated by finishing in a certain time. I'm learning that running is a lifelong sport and trusting that I've got plenty of time for speed to find me.\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.", "author_fullname": "t2_ij3sepa8", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Race Report: Madison Marathon - First Marathon and a COVID Comeback!", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "linkflair-racereport", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1gp00tq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 45, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Race Report", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 45, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1731351522.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.running", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;### Race Information&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* **Name:** Madison Marathon&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* **Date:** November 10, 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* **Distance:** 26.2 miles&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* **Location:** Madison, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* **Website:** &lt;a href=\"https://madisonmarathon.org/races/\"&gt;https://madisonmarathon.org/races/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* **Time:** 4:48:45&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;### Goals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| Goal | Description | Completed? |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;|------|-------------|------------|&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| A | Sub 4:40 | *No* |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| B | Sub 5:00 | *Yes* |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| C | Finish | *Yes* |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;### Splits&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| Mile | Time |&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;|------|------|&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 1 | 10:21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 2 | 10:36&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 3 | 10:29&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 4 | 10:31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 5 | 10:41&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 6 | 10:52&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 7 | 10:52&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 8 | 10:19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 9 | 10:39&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 10 | 10:21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 11 | 10:29&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 12 | 10:19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 13 | 10:14&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 14 | 10:24&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 15 | 10:24&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 16 | 10:19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 17 | 10:34&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 18 | 10:26&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 19 | 11:00&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 20 | 11:11&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 21 | 11:19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 22 | 11:52&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 23 | 12:22&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 24 | 12:02&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 25 | 12:08&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 26 | 12:46&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;| 27 | 4:35&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;### Training&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I (30F) started running during the pandemic, beginning from a place of not even being able to run one mile.

(Complicated, I know, but it gives me something to focus on, and I like the mix of chewing vs. slurping lol.) I saw my husband just before halfway, and it lifted my spirits even more. I was having a blast! The people in my pace group were amazing, and we had so much fun chatting and laughing together. I felt really really good until about mile 16, when I started noticing some pain in my knees. I was a little surprised given that it&amp;#39;s usually my hips that bug me. I thought maybe it would work itself out, but by mile 18, the pain was strong and persistent, and I knew I would need to start walking the hills or I would become too hurt to finish. I was never dejected though. I put on music for the first time and just focused on moving forward. I trusted my training and knew I could finish. At mile 22, a woman who had started with our pace group and slowed around mile 14 caught up to me and encouraged me to finish with her, promising we could walk all the hills together. She was amazing! I couldn&amp;#39;t have done it without her. I was in so much pain at that point, but we got through that last few miles together. It started pouring down rain, but I didn&amp;#39;t care. I was about to finish a marathon! The biggest hill was right at the end going up toward the Capitol. Once we topped it, I let myself run (hobble) to the finish, not realizing there was one final tiny uphill push. A course worker on a bike rode beside me, looking extremely concerned but encouraging me to keep going. I crossed the finish line in 4:48 with a huge smile on my face. I ran a freaking marathon! And more importantly, I had fun while doing it! Despite the pain and having to walk the hills the last few miles, I had an absolute blast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;### Post-race&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After crossing the finish line, I immediately grabbed a baked potato from the potato bar (again, Madison Marathon knows what&amp;#39;s up!), and my husband and our mutual friend stood and watched me while I sat on a bench eating the thing in the pouring rain lol. After some sustenance, I walked (hobbled) with my husband to a coffeeshop for a warm drink and some shelter, just smiling from ear to ear. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe how much fun I had had. While Chicago would have been great, I really think Madison was a perfect first marathon. Well-organized, a beautiful (albeit, hilly) course, great energy, and the perfect size crowd, imo. My legs are a little less stiff today, and I thankfully don&amp;#39;t think my knees are injured, just really, really sore. This will definitely not be my last marathon, and I learned a lot from the experience. I think being undertrained is what got to me. I definitely plan to build up my base even more, adding more weekly mileage overall and to do even more strength training. I would also be curious to see how I do on a course that isn&amp;#39;t quite so hilly, as I wonder if that also contributed to the issues with my knees. Most importantly, I learned that I have a much better time when I don&amp;#39;t let myself be so dictated by finishing in a certain time. I&amp;#39;m learning that running is a lifelong sport and trusting that I&amp;#39;ve got plenty of time for speed to find me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Made with a new [race report generator](&lt;a href=\"http://sfdavis.com/racereports/\"&gt;http://sfdavis.com/racereports/&lt;/a&gt;) created by &lt;a href=\"/u/herumph\"&gt;u/herumph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "941b9770-3f38-11e3-b90c-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0dd3bb", "id": "1gp00tq", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Any_Card_8061", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 19, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/running/comments/1gp00tq/race_report_madison_marathon_first_marathon_and_a/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1gp00tq/race_report_madison_marathon_first_marathon_and_a/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3688140, "created_utc": 1731351522.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "running", "selftext": "I'm looking for a recommendation to help me track my fitness while doing outdoor workouts.

I played a few sports recreationally growing up but was primarily a fluffy couch potato gamer with a little bit of muscle until this year.\n\nI tried to get into running for the first time early this year and ran about 100 miles across 2 months before going on vacation and having the habit slip. During this time I worked from a 13:00/mile zone 2 easy pace to about an 11min/mile zone 2 easy pace. \n\nIn June, my friends told me they had signed up for the BAA half and I signed up with a 1:50:00 estimated finish time not knowing it was a very good time for a half marathon. After finding out how difficult the goal would be, the desire to avoid embarrassing myself made me go all-in on getting into running. You can see my worry in this earlier post https://www.reddit.com/r/nikerunclub/comments/1dt8l0y/first_half_marathon_prep_am_i_delusional/\n\nAfter mulling it over for a bit I hired a coach and went from no running or race experience to racing two 10k's (49:23, 41:08) before this half marathon. Ran ~600 miles across 4.5 months from late June to present, peaking at a 44 mile week. During this time I kept lifting and went through a cut and started a bulk. During my cut and running noobie gains period, I saw massive improvements at a rapid pace over the first three months of training. Seeing the miles get longer and the pace get faster week after week was addicting, and the process of getting up early to get miles in became a core ritual in my life. \n\nHowever, the last month of my training I got sick at some point and everything started feeling off. I had to run slower to match my effort from a month ago, my sleep wasn't so great, and in general the workouts felt sluggish. During this time I was bulking and gained about 5 pounds so I chalked it up to that and maybe overtraining. As my training progressed I corrected my goals from a 1:50:00 time to 1:30:00, but decided to rein it back to 7:00/mile because of this sluggish training period. In the end I just trusted in the taper to bring it home on race day for the adjusted pace goal.\n\n\n### Pre-race\nThe day before the race I went to a tracksmith shakeout run. Turns out they planned do 3.8 miles at 8:30/mi pace and I was like wtf? Did 1 mile with them and swiftly ditched to do 2 easy miles at 10:00/mi pace.\n\nWave 1 start (my intended wave) starts at 8:07am. Woke up around 5:00am to eat about 100g carbs after carb loading about 500g the night before. Accomplished this carb load through a bunch of burritos, tacos, potatoes, and Chinese food the day before. In the morning of, I felt the spicy Chinese food brewing in my stomach and regretted my previous night's decisions. Took some caffeine and electrolytes to try to get everything moving and took care of business before leaving the hotel and taking the shuttle to the race. \n\nArrived at the race at 7:30am and rushed straight to the bathroom because I knew the Chinese food was gonna come out one way or the other in the next 2 hours. Waited right up until 8:00am to take the swiftest dump of my life before jogging to the start line. I ended up getting stuck in the mob around the start time and had to walk among the crowd for a long time. As I was walking with all the fellow runners, the gun shot and I patiently walked with the crowd until I could do a light jog across the start line.\n\n### Race\n\n**Mile 1**: I knew this was going to be the single largest and longest descent of the course where I could bank some time. Unfortunately due to my dinner decisions of the last night, I was stuck in a massive blob with no hope of running my goal pace down the glorious downhill. The first quarter mile was likely around a 9:00/mile pace which was frustrating. Tried my best to keep calm and play it smart. By the end of the first mile, I made it up to 7:15/mile after the crowd thinned out a bit.\n\n**Mile 2-4**: Spent these miles feeling things out given that it was my first time racing this distance. Still had to weave through some folks so I played it safe and just tried to keep near my goal pace, trying to get a gauge on how I felt. Overall, felt good but I knew the real race starts after the first 8 miles so I kept it to the effort I thought was 7:00/mile. At mile 4 I took my first ever cup from a hydration station and did better than I thought! Although I did splash a little water on the volunteer by accident I'm sorry.\n\n**Mile 5-7**: Took my first gel at mile 5 and was still feeling good. The hills were tough but I kind of got into a groove where going uphill was the working period and going downhill was a rest period. Still was feeling good but stayed at the existing effort because I was concerned for the remaining miles. Mentally I realized how much of a blessing it was to be able to experience this race. The amazingness of an event with so many runners, so many amazing people coming to cheer on complete strangers, so many volunteers, and logistical feats like hydration stations and bag check to accommodate thousands and thousands of people. In these moments I became thankful that the tides of life had somehow carried me to the sport of running.\n\n**Mile 7-11**: These miles I thought were gonna be pain, but they were not! My legs were a bit fatigued but I think the crowd support, adrenaline, and most importantly, training, was still keeping my mind and body strong. I knew I had to gotta start pushing it. I knew what a true all out effort felt like from my second 10k, and I knew I was nowhere near that. So I took a second gel at mile 8 and pushed the pace a bit faster and reminded myself to take in everything, the cheers, the high-fives, the running with like-minded individuals, and everything else that made up what was my first ever half marathon.\n\n**Mile 12**: Man, who put this hill here?\n\n**Mile 13**: After what was just hill after hill after hill in the last few miles, I came across the 12 mile sign and felt two emotions: relief and regret. I knew I had not put in my best effort in this race. My legs were not numb nor on fire, I did not feel like puking, and I did not at any point of the race feel like quitting. Nonetheless, it was what it was and all I could do was put in my best effort until the end. After one more painful as heck hill climb, I saw the finish line and crossed it with a swirl of emotions\n\n### Post-race\nDespite what I wrote about knowing I had left fuel in the tank, the race was by no means easy. I am proud of completing it and proud of my time. Most of all I was proud of the attitude I held to appreciate the race itself and proud of the fact that this result was made possible by ruthless dedication and discipline. \n\nIn true spirit of completing a long race, I went out to eat with friends and we all ordered two entrees ourselves. I think we had 3 different staff members all confirm that we wanted two entrees each lol. Food was glorious, legs were dead, and it was time to move on from the race. I've already signed up for a full marathon and I know my long term goals are to run a sub-3 marathon and eventually Boston qualify.

Ran it at 14 months postpartum after having to restart from scratch post C-section and being cleared to run again almost exactly one year ago. This was my first full but I\u2019ve ran 3 half marathons before, first (2:02) pre-pregnancy, second (1:52) at 6mo post partum, and the third (1:39) 4 weeks before NYC as a tune up race. \n\n**Training**\n\nI followed Hanson\u2019s marathon method - joined Luke Humphrey\u2019s run club and used his 55mpw NYC specific plan on Final Surge. The run club is actually really good value for what they call group coaching - no individualised plans, but can ask questions and will get good responses from the coaches, and they do monthly log checks so you can get feedback on how you\u2019re doing. I bought their lifetime membership for \\~$750 during a sale.\n\nThe plan is similar to the classic Advanced Hanson book plan but replaces some of the speed sessions with hill repeats. It alternated between hills workouts and the classic speed days, so you go up the ladder but don\u2019t come down. I ran 54 miles a week on average during the 16 week block, with 4 weeks above 60 miles, highest being 62. Each week consisted of 3 SOS days - speed or hills, goal pace tempo, and long run. 3 easy/recovery days. 1 rest or active recovery day. Ran 830+ miles total during the 16 week segment. Before the segment I ran 45mpw (all easy) for \\~3 months to base build.\n\nThe structure of Hansons worked very well for me. I liked there was never 2 hard days in a row and I could get my easy runs done around an hour and my SOS days around 1.5 hours, with the long run around 2-2.5 hours. This was important because I had to get all my runs done by 7.30-8am, because 1) baby wakes up, 2) sun comes up at 7am and temps go above 90 degrees by 8am. So the 16 mile long run was a great fit for me (and even then entailed a 5am start). There was never a question whether I will finish 26.2 having only ran 16, because we're making a whole trip out of this and I knew I was definitely going to finish.\n\nI didn\u2019t miss a single run. I didn\u2019t perfectly execute every workout, but only had 2 or 3 bad ones and did my best to make up for those as I can. I extended some of the long runs - plan had 3x 16 milers sandwiched by 14 milers, I did 4x 16 milers and extended 1 more to 18 miles. It wasn\u2019t necessary but I was comfortably running my long runs under 3 hours and it was still within their guidance of keeping the distance to 30% of weekly volume so I figured why not.\n\nI ran to a 3:40 goal pace during training, when it\u2019s consistently 86-90+ degrees and 85%+ humidity. I hoped the cooler weather in NYC will translate that to a 3:30 equivalent. 3:30 was the BQ standard for me when I started training hence I set that as my stretch goal. The tune up half that I ran in 1:39 confirmed I should theoretically be able to run a 3:30 full per the equivalency calculators. I went into the race feeling pretty confident.\n\nTaper went from 60 miles on the last peak week, to 50 miles, 45 miles, and 20 miles on race week. I felt great the entire time. The 2 weeks before race week still had SOS days but shorter/easier. \n\nNutrition wise I practiced getting in 60g of carbs per hour on every SOS day. It was rough in the beginning and I had to play around with a lot of different gels, electrolytes etc but I figured it out in the end.\u00a0\n\nOne thing I neglected was real weight training. I did 3-4 yoga classes every week with at least 1 session being a strength based vinyasa class, and felt a lot better than when I tried to force 1-2 weight sessions. I was injury and niggles free for the entire segment. But I\u2019m not sure if this came back to bite me on race day.\u00a0\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nThis was tough. I flew in from Singapore, so it was a 18 hour direct flight, with a one year old. Flew in on Thursday and figured will have a few days to recover, but I never recovered or slept a consistent stretch from the time I got on the plane because baby+jetlag=disaster. We picked up our race packet on Thursday, walked around a bit on Friday, and went to Central Park for a shakeout run / to figure out post-race logistics on Saturday.\u00a0\n\nCarb-loading went well. Followed Featherstone Nutrition's guidelines.  I had to eat 400g for 3 days. Did 2 bagels and a banana (125g+) for breakfast, pasta and udon for lunch and dinner (don\u2019t know exact macros since we were eating out), and drank a Maurten 320 (80g) on top.\u00a0\n\nNight before the race I slept maybe 3 or 4 hours. Jetlag, plus some incident downstairs at 3am with 3 police cars showing up and the people downstairs having a mental breakdown crying non-stop. I got up at 4am, my Garmin body battery was only 70. My dad drove me to the New Jersey bus spot at 5.30am and I got in the start village just before 7am. My corral opened at 9:45am and I started running at 10.20am. There was no pacers for what I wanted to run in my corral as I initially put a 4hour estimated finish when I registered and my tune up half result was after NYRR\u2019s strict cut off for when you can update your best pace.\n\nIt was a long, COLD wait. I had lots of throwaway layers but was still freezing. I was first in line to see the therapy dogs, which helped a bit. Every race should have therapy dogs! Ate a bagel and a banana on the bus and sipped slowly on a Maurten 320 while I waited. Toilet wait wasn\u2019t too bad, but man the ports potties are a lot more gross than the ones in Asia.\u00a0\n\n**Race**\n\nI lined up at the front of my corral before they opened, then jogged close to the front of the wave after the corrals opened. I took pace bands for 3:30, 3:35, 3:40 at the expo, wore the 3:30 and 3:40 ones as bookends. First time using them and found them really hard to read as you\u2019re running.\n\nComing from hot to cold weather, running felt A LOT  easier and I went out too fast. Averaged 7:50 for the first 10 miles, mile 2 was sub-7\u2026 I was about 1 min faster than the 3:30 pace band by mile 10 and felt really good, then slipped and had a bad fall and lost a lot of momentum. I was about a minute behind the 3:30 pace band by halfway and after the mile 13 bridge my quads started to feel a bit shaky, which made me panic a bit knowing mile 16 and 24 hills were still to come. Never full on cramps, but felt a bit weak if you know what I mean? My right ankle was also a bit iffy after the fall and I made an executive decision then to ease up, and ran to what felt like my long run pace effort. I decided to prioritise making sure I had enough in the tank to finish strong and not bonk or have to walk at the end. I also lost my salt pills somewhere between mile 4 and 8 (had planned to take them every 4 miles) which also made me a bit scared since I\u2019m a heavy sweater.\u00a0\n\nBrooklyn was the best stretch. I wrote my name on duct tape and had it on my shirt for the first 8 or so miles before it fell off. Hearing folks cheer me on specifically was really empowering and I\u2019m sad I didn\u2019t prepare better by printing my name on my shirt so I could\u2019ve had that the whole way. Crowds were great the entire way but it\u2019s not quite the same without your name. I  did go out too fast on the first half because of this tho.\n\nThe second half was not too bad, since I eased up. My quads were tired but everything else was fine, I focused on just keeping moving and going by effort. I never felt like I hit the wall but mentally I was exhausted - never had to concentrate for so long before! By this point I stopped checking my pace bands and looking at my watch. I focused on when do I get to eat my next gel, when do I have to refill my handheld. Mile 17-20 were the worst I think, once I hit the Bronx I knew it was only a mile in the Bronx then we get to come back down to Central Park and that was the end. It was comforting knowing there was only 6 miles left, since that's the duration of my easy runs and less than an hour. Mile 24 was tough on my legs, but mentally it was easy to just chug along because I knew it was the last big hill. I tried to speed up after the mile 24 climb to get back under 3:40 but it was quite congested with a lot of walkers, and I ended up missing my goal by 1 minute. \n\nI think the hills were definitely something I was unprepared for. I ran hills in training but the longest repeats were 4min and I don\u2019t think I had enough total hill volume throughout the week. My typical week was around 1200-1500ft of elevation gain, and my long runs only 500ft. NYC was 900ft of gain and 950ft of loss. My quads were unprepared, maybe if I did weighted squats it would\u2019ve helped? I definitely went down mile 2 too fast but GPS was wonky under the bridge and I had no idea what I was running.\u00a0\n\nBiggest lesson for next time - start more conservative.\u00a0If I didn't fall, or if the last 2 miles were less congested, I'm confident I could have made sub-3:40. But if I had executed better and ran a more even split, maybe I could've had 3:35. 3:30 was probably out of reach all along in NYC tho given the hills. \n\nI ate 9 gels total - took 8 Maurtens (2 caffeinated) with me with plans to eat one every 3 miles, and took an extra SIS gel on course. Ended up eating one every 2 miles after mile 20. Felt great during the race but a bit nauseous afterwards. \n\n**Post-race**\n\nThe walk out of Central Park is horrendous. I tried to sit down for a bit and someone came almost immediately to pull me up! I finished right around 2pm and met my family around 2:30. Phones didn\u2019t work, so decide on a place to meet beforehand.\u00a0\n\nOne other thing I wished I had done- wear a throwaway pair of shoes to the start. I wore my Endorphin Elites and my feet were in pain by the second half. I\u2019ve worn them on long runs before but never for so long - from 5.30am to 2.30pm! It took me insanely long to walk the post-race stretch because my feet hurt so bad.\u00a0\n\nI didn't feel hungry and skipped lunch, then had an early steak dinner to celebrate. Overall quite happy with the first marathon experience and can\u2019t wait to do it again in London next year!

Ran it at 14 months postpartum after having to restart from scratch post C-section and being cleared to run again almost exactly one year ago. This was my first full but I\u2019ve ran 3 half marathons before, first (2:02) pre-pregnancy, second (1:52) at 6mo post partum, and the third (1:39) 4 weeks before NYC as a tune up race. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed Hanson\u2019s marathon method - joined Luke Humphrey\u2019s run club and used his 55mpw NYC specific plan on Final Surge. The run club is actually really good value for what they call group coaching - no individualised plans, but can ask questions and will get good responses from the coaches, and they do monthly log checks so you can get feedback on how you\u2019re doing. I bought their lifetime membership for ~$750 during a sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plan is similar to the classic Advanced Hanson book plan but replaces some of the speed sessions with hill repeats. It alternated between hills workouts and the classic speed days, so you go up the ladder but don\u2019t come down. I ran 54 miles a week on average during the 16 week block, with 4 weeks above 60 miles, highest being 62. Each week consisted of 3 SOS days - speed or hills, goal pace tempo, and long run. 3 easy/recovery days. 1 rest or active recovery day. Ran 830+ miles total during the 16 week segment. Before the segment I ran 45mpw (all easy) for ~3 months to base build.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The structure of Hansons worked very well for me. I liked there was never 2 hard days in a row and I could get my easy runs done around an hour and my SOS days around 1.5 hours, with the long run around 2-2.5 hours. This was important because I had to get all my runs done by 7.30-8am, because 1) baby wakes up, 2) sun comes up at 7am and temps go above 90 degrees by 8am. So the 16 mile long run was a great fit for me (and even then entailed a 5am start). There was never a question whether I will finish 26.2 having only ran 16, because we&amp;#39;re making a whole trip out of this and I knew I was definitely going to finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t miss a single run. I didn\u2019t perfectly execute every workout, but only had 2 or 3 bad ones and did my best to make up for those as I can. I extended some of the long runs - plan had 3x 16 milers sandwiched by 14 milers, I did 4x 16 milers and extended 1 more to 18 miles. It wasn\u2019t necessary but I was comfortably running my long runs under 3 hours and it was still within their guidance of keeping the distance to 30% of weekly volume so I figured why not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran to a 3:40 goal pace during training, when it\u2019s consistently 86-90+ degrees and 85%+ humidity. I hoped the cooler weather in NYC will translate that to a 3:30 equivalent. 3:30 was the BQ standard for me when I started training hence I set that as my stretch goal. The tune up half that I ran in 1:39 confirmed I should theoretically be able to run a 3:30 full per the equivalency calculators. I went into the race feeling pretty confident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taper went from 60 miles on the last peak week, to 50 miles, 45 miles, and 20 miles on race week. I felt great the entire time. The 2 weeks before race week still had SOS days but shorter/easier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nutrition wise I practiced getting in 60g of carbs per hour on every SOS day. It was rough in the beginning and I had to play around with a lot of different gels, electrolytes etc but I figured it out in the end.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I neglected was real weight training. I did 3-4 yoga classes every week with at least 1 session being a strength based vinyasa class, and felt a lot better than when I tried to force 1-2 weight sessions. I was injury and niggles free for the entire segment. But I\u2019m not sure if this came back to bite me on race day.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was tough. I flew in from Singapore, so it was a 18 hour direct flight, with a one year old. Flew in on Thursday and figured will have a few days to recover, but I never recovered or slept a consistent stretch from the time I got on the plane because baby+jetlag=disaster. We picked up our race packet on Thursday, walked around a bit on Friday, and went to Central Park for a shakeout run / to figure out post-race logistics on Saturday.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carb-loading went well. Followed Featherstone Nutrition&amp;#39;s guidelines.  I had to eat 400g for 3 days. Did 2 bagels and a banana (125g+) for breakfast, pasta and udon for lunch and dinner (don\u2019t know exact macros since we were eating out), and drank a Maurten 320 (80g) on top.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Night before the race I slept maybe 3 or 4 hours. Jetlag, plus some incident downstairs at 3am with 3 police cars showing up and the people downstairs having a mental breakdown crying non-stop. I got up at 4am, my Garmin body battery was only 70. My dad drove me to the New Jersey bus spot at 5.30am and I got in the start village just before 7am. My corral opened at 9:45am and I started running at 10.20am. There was no pacers for what I wanted to run in my corral as I initially put a 4hour estimated finish when I registered and my tune up half result was after NYRR\u2019s strict cut off for when you can update your best pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a long, COLD wait. I had lots of throwaway layers but was still freezing. I was first in line to see the therapy dogs, which helped a bit. Every race should have therapy dogs! Ate a bagel and a banana on the bus and sipped slowly on a Maurten 320 while I waited. Toilet wait wasn\u2019t too bad, but man the ports potties are a lot more gross than the ones in Asia.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lined up at the front of my corral before they opened, then jogged close to the front of the wave after the corrals opened.

I wanted to challenge myself to a longer distance after finishing with a little something in my legs.\n\nThe southern part of the Swedish west coast is quite flat with the exception of Kullaberg which shoots out of the sea and has a high point of 188m. The course started with two laps of Kullaberg and if you made it passed the 11 hour cut off it was 100km of largely flat running with a variety of surfaces sand, gravel, dirt, bitumen and don't forget rocks. Lots of rocks. To keep things interesting there were two large hills to run/climb up with 20km to go.\n\n**Training**\n\nI had managed to increase my training to 28km / week for the previous 6 months which was a lot better than other years. I had run a marathon and a 26km race but no other real long runs. I was happy with all my gear from the previous ultra so I just went with what I had and ignored all the sales of the flash new gear. \n\n**Race Strategy**\n\nI wasn't going for the podium and my only mission was to get the 100 miles done safely before the 32-hour cut-off time.\n\nThe race started at 18:00, there was an 11 hour cut off to get the 2 laps of Kullaberg done. I would wear trail shoes at the start and switch to comfier runners for the second 80km.\n\nMy nutrition strategy was to eat a gel and a chocolate bar (100cal + 225cal) per hour, keep drinking and ideally have empty water bottles upon arrival at each aid station. At the aid stations grab some sports drink and perhaps some light soup, and try and avoid things that looked like they would take time to digest.\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nThe race was starting at 18:00 on Friday and I was up at 04:00. I have been sleeping poorly for the last month and this sleep deprivation was a concern, if I was just going to make the 32 hour cut off - 46 hours awake while running is a looooong time.\n\nThe Swedish summer had rolled into a warm autumn and it was feeling like almost shorts weather. But the forecast predicted the first near zero night and the wind was blowing the car around on the drive up to B\u00e5stad. The race briefing was a nice event, just being out of the wind was fantastic. Also kinda cool seeing some pretty fast runners both local and international.\n\n**Race**\n\nThe knight riding with the lit torch lead the 710 of us out of H\u00f6gern\u00e5s. We had been buffered from the wind in the starting area, but now running on the sea path the wind and sea spray were reminding us what we had signed up for. A gentle run up the coast to M\u00f6lle to start the first lap of Kullaberg. There were significant queues in the rocky sections of the course and a few brave souls were out there to cheer us on. The ground was mostly dry but the leaf litter hid a few ankle twisting rocks. The glow of the headlamp helped but there were still some jarring twists and stubbed toes. The uphills were tough and some of the downhill sections were just as much work.\n\nFinally arriving back in M\u00f6lle about three and a half hours after setting out on Kullaberg. A resupply and then back to it. This time the body was wearier and the supporters had disappeared. The temperature was dropping and the wind was biting with more ferocity. We avoided slowing down too much to make the cut off a non issue and allow some time to take on some food in M\u00f6lle we pushed on through the dark and the tiredness.\n\nArriving in M\u00f6lle - a bite to eat and a quick warm up by a heater and we were back into the wind and quickly shivering again. We ran over the ridge and eastwards off the point to start the flatter sections. My running buddy started to struggle with food and we slowed down for this section. I wasn't enjoying the chocolate and gel combination much either. It started to get worse for him and I noticed my body feeling the cold and tiredness more at this reduced speed. I was wondering it I was going to need this walking time later on in the race. We separated so that he could run at the pace he needed to hopefully recover. I felt the stress of the cut off nearing and switched into some anxiety running. I was around position 530 at this point.\n\nThe sun rose over the water around Farhult and thousands of birds danced forming constellations then quickly reforming into another shape in moments later. It was memorizing after a night of darkness. My legs seemed to be on autopilot and were passing people whenever possible. Some areas were familiar from the run 2 years ago, coming from the other direction. But some of the kilometers felt like they had turned into miles. The running was fantastic.\n\nFinally arriving in the R\u00e5bocka aid station with warm meals and drop bags. I managed to switch shoes to make the impact a little bit less noticeable on the coming flat kilometers. Also a fresh portable charger meant I could charge my phone. My one mess up was mistaking one charging cable for another. I checked my phone and my buddy appeared to be bowing out. I took a little longer hoping I would catch him. I did my best to eat anything that wasn't sugary as I was struggling with anything sugary at this point.\n\nIt really took a bit to get moving again after such a long stop. But then once the legs found their rhythm they kept at it and I took advantage of the flats. My vest became magic and for the rest of the race whenever I needed anything the vest supplied anything at first grab. I still felt the cut off was approaching and I had to use my legs while they felt good. It felt like forever before the next aid station appeared it felt like a weird dream where you were always doing one more thing before it would appear and after doing it you would do another. I filled up my drinks and tried to finally chill a bit with the pace. I was nervous about the big hills but had gained some time on the cut off.\n\nThe next sections had easy little trails, sometimes gravel tracks, some bitumen at times and punctuating all this random rock fields that made holding any pace impossible for me. I tried the make the most of the sun still being up and sped up knowing the sunlight probably wont help much on the hills but it certainly makes running in these areas a lot easier. \n\nAs Hovs Hallar rest stop I tried eating bread with cheese but my mouth felt so dry. I was 3.5 hours under cut off but worried that my lack of energy would push me into a wall and I would struggle to even walk the last 20 km. I tried to have more of the supplied sports drink basically for its uniqueness and so that I definitely had some energy. The first hill was incredible, water streaming over rocks for hundreds of meters and downhill was just as bad. I was wondering how I was going to manage 14km of this before the last flat 6 km in B\u00e5stad. I felt the fatigue in my head and couldn't really work out how many caffeinated gels I had consumed. But one more seemed to clear the fog. I was expecting an aid station at the entry to B\u00e5stad as there was a cut off there. But I hadn't understood the course guide. So what seemed like an endless march looking for a basic aid station ended up taking me to the final ramp. And there I was able to run up the final ramp for my first 100 mile finish in 250th place or so (from 750 starters). My stress running overtaking lots of people (and I guess a few withdraw ahead of me).\n\n**Post-race**\n\nMy training buddy had just arrived in time to meet me at the finish, I had been expecting to get in hours later. Thank goodness he did as I wasn't up to doing much myself apart from passing out. The tomato stew at the end was heavenly.\n\nLooking at myself, I think my lack of eating would have got to me quite soon. I look a little gaunt today and I am craving salt. Don't worry, I'm still drinking a fair bit of water.\n\n**Questions for the audience!**\n\nWhat are you fueling with to avoid food fatigue? \n\nWhat is the best food you have ever received at an aid stop?\n\n", "author_fullname": "t2_4jvxk", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Kullamannen Ultra 100 miles", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "linkflair-racereport", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1gmsx0w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 57, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Race Report", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 57, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1731099494.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.running", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;/strong&gt; Kullamannen Ultra 100 miles&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When?&lt;/strong&gt; 1-3 November 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How far?&lt;/strong&gt; 159.5km (100 Miles)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where?&lt;/strong&gt; Southern part of the west coast of Sweden (H\u00f6gern\u00e4s, M\u00f6lle, \u00c4ngelholm &amp;amp; B\u00e5stad)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://kullamannen.utmb.world/races/ultra-100-miles\"&gt;https://kullamannen.utmb.world/races/ultra-100-miles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strava activity:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/12801037825\"&gt;https://www.strava.com/activities/12801037825&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/12807679702\"&gt;https://www.strava.com/activities/12807679702&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I signed up for the 100 miles Kullamannen last year after the after the Kullamannen 100km trail race. I wanted to challenge myself to a longer distance after finishing with a little something in my legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The southern part of the Swedish west coast is quite flat with the exception of Kullaberg which shoots out of the sea and has a high point of 188m. The course started with two laps of Kullaberg and if you made it passed the 11 hour cut off it was 100km of largely flat running with a variety of surfaces sand, gravel, dirt, bitumen and don&amp;#39;t forget rocks. Lots of rocks. To keep things interesting there were two large hills to run/climb up with 20km to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had managed to increase my training to 28km / week for the previous 6 months which was a lot better than other years. I had run a marathon and a 26km race but no other real long runs. I was happy with all my gear from the previous ultra so I just went with what I had and ignored all the sales of the flash new gear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t going for the podium and my only mission was to get the 100 miles done safely before the 32-hour cut-off time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The race started at 18:00, there was an 11 hour cut off to get the 2 laps of Kullaberg done. I would wear trail shoes at the start and switch to comfier runners for the second 80km.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My nutrition strategy was to eat a gel and a chocolate bar (100cal + 225cal) per hour, keep drinking and ideally have empty water bottles upon arrival at each aid station. At the aid stations grab some sports drink and perhaps some light soup, and try and avoid things that looked like they would take time to digest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The race was starting at 18:00 on Friday and I was up at 04:00. I have been sleeping poorly for the last month and this sleep deprivation was a concern, if I was just going to make the 32 hour cut off - 46 hours awake while running is a looooong time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Swedish summer had rolled into a warm autumn and it was feeling like almost shorts weather. But the forecast predicted the first near zero night and the wind was blowing the car around on the drive up to B\u00e5stad. The race briefing was a nice event, just being out of the wind was fantastic. Also kinda cool seeing some pretty fast runners both local and international.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The knight riding with the lit torch lead the 710 of us out of H\u00f6gern\u00e5s. We had been buffered from the wind in the starting area, but now running on the sea path the wind and sea spray were reminding us what we had signed up for. A gentle run up the coast to M\u00f6lle to start the first lap of Kullaberg. There were significant queues in the rocky sections of the course and a few brave souls were out there to cheer us on. The ground was mostly dry but the leaf litter hid a few ankle twisting rocks. The glow of the headlamp helped but there were still some jarring twists and stubbed toes. The uphills were tough and some of the downhill sections were just as much work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally arriving back in M\u00f6lle about three and a half hours after setting out on Kullaberg.

I'm not the youngest or faster runner out there, and when I was younger, I'd always overtrain and under-prepare. Now, I am taking my pre and post-run stretching and prep more seriously. In my journey to be proactive about preparation, I came across these articles about barefoot running and how our feet should/could be ideally structured.\n\nMy arches have/are falling, so I have worn orthotics for several years now, but I'm wondering if I can improve my overall foot health and drop the orthotics. I don't have severe foot problems, but along with my arches, my toes can be uncooperative/inflexible when doing lunges or other activities requiring deep bending in the toes.

Since then I've run the London Marathon twice, and got super lucky in the NY  ballot earlier this year. My running has slowly been improving with time &amp; patience, and I've been upping the intensity of my training. I knew NY was going to be a huge test and a tough course. For reference, my previous marathon times were: Rome 2017: 4:15, London 2023 - 3:36, London 2024 - 3:23. \n\n**Training**\n\nThe main issue I faced in training (like so many others, I know) is time. Between two young kids and full-time work, it can be so challenging just fitting in the amount of runs needed to keep progressing. For this year's London Marathon, I used Runna which on the whole was really good, but for NY I decided to get a coach (in the loosest sense) who formulated my plans based on the previous week's training and what I could physically fit in each week. \n\n  \nI really enjoyed this approach, and the flexibility and human interaction gave me confidence that I wasn't slipping way off schedule by missing a run here and there. \n\n  \nOn the whole I was averaging 4 runs a week, and I did 5 where at all possible. This generally consisted of 1 easy, 2 tempo/interval &amp; 1 long run each week. Volume wise I was averaging  between 50k - 60k for the most part, maxing out around 75km towards the back end. I know I'll likely need to increase this volume to keep progressing at my age. \n\nThe block on the whole was great, the speed sessions crushed me but sure enough my times were coming down. Health wise I was good besides a hamstring injury which wiped out 3 weeks of tempo sessions in the middle of the block. \n\nHeading into the taper I felt good - my last long run (35k) was at target marathon pace and I did a sub 1:30 HM 2 weeks out. Fitness felt good, legs felt good. \n\n**Pre-race**\n\nA trip to New York is amazing at any time, but to go out there to run the marathon was very surreal. I felt a mixture of excitement/nerves/feel great/feel shit/going to crush this/going to crumble. And everything in between. I would swing from feeling like a sub 3:10 was coming, to doubting whether I was fit enough to run it. The mind games for this one had serious muscles. \n\nMy wife and I headed out to NY on the Thursday. No kids, no work, time to ourselves. Bliss. I sort of put to the back of my mind that I was actually there to run, we just had a great time together. \n\nThe carb loading was a pleasure - all the pizza and bagels I could stomach. \n\nThe day before, my best friend &amp; his wife surprised me while I was having lunch - they'd flown out from London to come and join us. I was so happy, the best trip just got even better.\n\n**Race**\n\nI hadn't fully adjusted from London time, so the 4.30am wake up on race day wasn't actually too bad. I slept well and was ready to go.\n\n  \nI know many people have said what a nightmare the logistics can be in getting over to the start on Staten Island, but luckily this was all plain sailing. I was straight on a ferry with no wait time and then straight on a bus at the other end. The only slight drag was the wait to get into the start corrals - I was in Wave 1 which meant I had about two hours to kill. I know some people had way longer to wait than that, so I couldn't complain too much. \n\nAlthough my A goal was just to PR, I felt I had a really good chance of getting around 3:12. I knew the NY course was going to be tougher than I'd run run before, and I'd studied the various elevation points to try and plan ahead. I'm quite a slow burner usually, and my previous two marathons were both negative splits where I gradually grew stronger as the race developed. Given the increased elevation in the second half of this race, I decided I'd try a slightly more aggressive first half to make the most of the relatively gentle terrain in Brooklyn. \n\nThe uphill start on the Verrazano Bridge worked perfectly for this - I was able to start out super chilled for the first 2K before settling into a quicker pace as we headed into Brooklyn. The first 12 miles absolutely flew by - the crowds were incredible, there were high 5s aplenty and I just kept thinking how cool it was to be running this race. I saw my wife &amp; friends at mile 8 which was the best they got to see of me - I really did feel so comfortable. \n\n  \nI crossed the halfway point in 1:36 - I was happy &amp; my pace felt good and sustainable. Shortly after, around  mile 14, I struggled with one of my gels. As soon as I took it, I could feel a stitch coming on. These were the same gels I'd used in training as well as previous races, so I knew there was no issue with unfamiliarity. \n\n  \nThe stitch faded but I was left with a nagging discomfort down my side. Up next was the Queensboro Bridge as we headed into Manhattan. I knew this was one of the elevated sections to navigate and it came at a bad time, having just had the stitch issue. The first thing you notice about the Queensboro is there are no spectators - you go from a wall of noise to just the sound of shoes on tarmac. This is where the race turned for me - barely a mile previously I was flying and feeling so good about things. But I was beginning to unravel - I went inside my own head and could only think about how hard this was. Also, the elevation is no joke. It may look relatively modest on paper, and others clearly dealt with it better than I did, but to me it seemed unrelenting. \n\nI entered Manhattan and was in the trenches. Every marathon is difficult, they're supposed to be, and the struggle will always hit at some stage. But it came way earlier then I was expecting/hoping. And a lot more intense too. \n\nMy quads were beginning to cramp which was restricting my stride, and I was still having problems taking on gels. Every time I tried, I got a stitch. I decided to ditch them entirely - the choice was try and finish without any more fuel or have to stop/start each time I tried. I chose the best of two crap options. \n\n  \nDespite how bad I was feeling by this point, my pace hadn't dipped too drastically. I was slower than the first half but still managing to hold things together just about. I wasn't enjoying the crowds as much by now, I was totally within myself and just trying to keep one foot in front of the other. \n\n  \nI knew the final big chunk of elevation was to come - and come it did. Mile 23, 5th Avenue. I'm pretty sure this is the final resting place of my soul. It's no exaggeration to say it took everything I had to physically keep running. \n\nIt was at this stage the 3:15 pace group went past me, and I knew sub 3:15 was gone. I did my best to cling on to them in sight, but it was tortuous to see them slowly inch further and further away. \n\n  \nThe final few miles went by in a bit of a blur. I knew by this point that there was no danger of me not finishing, and that offered some relief, but I think I was a bit shell-shocked at what had unfurled over the previous 10 miles. \n\n  \nCentral Park was a sight for sore eyes - but the steady rollers there ensured I'd endure further turmoil right until the end. Never been happier to see a finish line, and have never had to dig as deep as I did in that race. \n\n**Post-race**\n\nAt the finish line, pain gave way to relief. I suddenly felt so pleased that I'd managed to hold on for 3:16. I hadn't felt like that would be possible. \n\nOnce I got away from Central Park I caught up with my wife &amp; friends. The rest of the day &amp; evening was spent just as it should - plenty of beers, laughs, pizza, and bed. \n\nAs of now, I am still unsure whether I had a good day or bad day on Sunday. Was it good that I bagged a PR on a tough course? Or was it alarming how brutal the second half was? I am not sure -  the answer perhaps is somewhere in between. \n\n  \nOverall, this really was the trip of a lifetime. As a Londoner, I love my home town race. But New York tops it for me. I couldn't be more pleased to have completed this marathon, and perhaps one day I will be able to return to face my demons of miles 15 &amp; 23. \n\n  \nLooking forward, I want to keep trying to improve, and I have the Copenhagen marathon coming up in May. Plenty of time to reflect and work out how to approach that one. No bridges, I hear! \n\n  \n", "author_fullname": "t2_j809eoe9s", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "NYC Marathon 2024", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "linkflair-racereport", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1gluwel", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 104, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Race Report", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 104, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1730997964.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.running", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0New York City Marathon&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a03 November 2024&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a042.2km&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0New York City, NY&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a03:16:05&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goal A - PR (3:23) - Yes&lt;br/&gt;\nGoal B - Sub 3:15 - No&lt;br/&gt;\nGoal C - Sub 3:12 - No&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;KM - Pace (min/km)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 - 5:34&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 - 4:46&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 - 4:21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 - 4:33&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 - 4:25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6 - 4:28&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 - 4:31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8 - 4:19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9 - 4:16&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 - 4:23&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11 - 4:17&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12 - 4:20&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13 - 4:37&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14 - 4:31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15 - 4:12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16 - 4:22&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17 - 4:22&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18 - 4:25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;19 - 4:21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20 - 4:28&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;21 - 4:25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;22 - 4:27&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;23 - 4:18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24 - 4:27&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25 - 4:35&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;26 - 4:25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;27 - 4:30&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;28 - 4:42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;29 - 4:31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30 - 4:23&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;31 - 4:32&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;32 - 4:33&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;33 - 4:40&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;34 - 4:36&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;35 - 4:34&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;36 - 4:42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;37 - 4:32&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;38 - 5:04&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;39 - 4:56&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;40 - 4:51&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;41 - 5:09&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;42 - 4:53&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I (M38, London) started running semi-consistently about 2 years ago, in an attempt to keep fit after injury caused to me quit playing football.

This is where the race turned for me - barely a mile previously I was flying and feeling so good about things. But I was beginning to unravel - I went inside my own head and could only think about how hard this was. Also, the elevation is no joke. It may look relatively modest on paper, and others clearly dealt with it better than I did, but to me it seemed unrelenting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I entered Manhattan and was in the trenches. Every marathon is difficult, they&amp;#39;re supposed to be, and the struggle will always hit at some stage. But it came way earlier then I was expecting/hoping. And a lot more intense too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My quads were beginning to cramp which was restricting my stride, and I was still having problems taking on gels. Every time I tried, I got a stitch. I decided to ditch them entirely - the choice was try and finish without any more fuel or have to stop/start each time I tried. I chose the best of two crap options. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite how bad I was feeling by this point, my pace hadn&amp;#39;t dipped too drastically. I was slower than the first half but still managing to hold things together just about. I wasn&amp;#39;t enjoying the crowds as much by now, I was totally within myself and just trying to keep one foot in front of the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew the final big chunk of elevation was to come - and come it did. Mile 23, 5th Avenue. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure this is the final resting place of my soul. It&amp;#39;s no exaggeration to say it took everything I had to physically keep running. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was at this stage the 3:15 pace group went past me, and I knew sub 3:15 was gone. I did my best to cling on to them in sight, but it was tortuous to see them slowly inch further and further away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final few miles went by in a bit of a blur. I knew by this point that there was no danger of me not finishing, and that offered some relief, but I think I was a bit shell-shocked at what had unfurled over the previous 10 miles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Central Park was a sight for sore eyes - but the steady rollers there ensured I&amp;#39;d endure further turmoil right until the end. Never been happier to see a finish line, and have never had to dig as deep as I did in that race. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the finish line, pain gave way to relief. I suddenly felt so pleased that I&amp;#39;d managed to hold on for 3:16. I hadn&amp;#39;t felt like that would be possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I got away from Central Park I caught up with my wife &amp;amp; friends. The rest of the day &amp;amp; evening was spent just as it should - plenty of beers, laughs, pizza, and bed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of now, I am still unsure whether I had a good day or bad day on Sunday. Was it good that I bagged a PR on a tough course? Or was it alarming how brutal the second half was? I am not sure -  the answer perhaps is somewhere in between. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, this really was the trip of a lifetime. As a Londoner, I love my home town race. But New York tops it for me. I couldn&amp;#39;t be more pleased to have completed this marathon, and perhaps one day I will be able to return to face my demons of miles 15 &amp;amp; 23. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, I want to keep trying to improve, and I have the Copenhagen marathon coming up in May. Plenty of time to reflect and work out how to approach that one. No bridges, I hear! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "941b9770-3f38-11e3-b90c-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0dd3bb", "id": "1gluwel", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Competitive-Rush-935", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 32, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/running/comments/1gluwel/nyc_marathon_2024/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1gluwel/nyc_marathon_2024/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3688140, "created_utc": 1730997964.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "running", "selftext": "2 years ago I felt a slight pinch in my hip and since then I have not been able to run without pain in my lower back and hip.

23:00\n\n### Background\nFor some context, in my mid-twenties, I made it a goal/bucket list item/thirty-by-thirty goal to run a race a year (5k, 10k, half, full, etc) leading up to my 30th birthday. It was an idea, but I never really put myself to it. It was always a start/stop until I signed up for my first 5k in 11/2023. I trained (admittedly not very diligently), but missed it due to testing positive for COVID.\n\nCome early-2024, at work, a new team member joins the team and I casually mention how I've thought about running. Not knowing she was a runner, she said: \"do it. Sign up for them and don't look back.\"\n\nSo, I signed up for an 8k, five mile, 5k, and another 5 mile. Completed them, was feeling good, and set the lofty goal of completing a half-marathon.\n\n### Training\nI have been long-time lurking on the sub going back and forth on training plans in preparation for this half-marathon.\n\nEventually, I landed on this one: https://www.halfmarathons.net/couch-to-half-marathon/\n\nThis was the most diligent I was towards training. I was hitting the mileage, tracking calories, etc. It felt good. Ironically, the 5k and the five miler lined up with the prescribed weekend long-run mileage, so it was a nice check-in to have.\n\nBut, admittedly, between (most probably) the important weeks of training, I fell off due to a job change and nearly every weekend in September/early-October being booked. It became really hard to find time to get runs in (lesson learned for next time).\n\nThe week before the race, my co-worker and I just did a long run together hitting eight-and-some-change miles.\n\nAnd so, race time.\n\n### Pre-Race\nI was nervous as heck. Thoughts like \"I definitely didn't train enough\" and stuff like that was keeping me on edge. I spent the last two days hydrating like crazy; Making sure I was preparing as best I could.\n\nMy fiancee, family, and friends all drove down the morning of. I was listening to my race/workout playlist to get in the zone trying to make sure I was locked in.\n\n### Race\nThe weather was actually really beautiful that day. The sun was out, it was clear; A little nippy in the morning but eventually warmed up a bit.\n\nMy co-worker/friend and I lined up. The race starting line was BUZZING. That energy was just insane to see. I started my watch a bit earlier from gun-time (just so that whenever I looked at my watch, the time would kick me in the butt to keep going), and just like that, we were off.\n\nI didn't really have any hard goals related to time or pace; My prior paces in the previous races revolved around 11/12 minutes per mile. It was a really \"nice-to-have\" if I kept to that, but my only goal was to finish.\n\nFirst couple of miles, we were cruising. Had to take some walks every once in a while but I played that game of \"hit that sign, we run again.\" We hit a tunnel and I learned of the tunnel echo chamber where everyone just hypes each other up; It was really cool to see that.\n\nWe're making our way through AC and we see the boardwalk again! My friend reminds me; \"hey, we hit the boardwalk. We're at 5 to go.\" The volunteers was hyping everyone up; I looked at the time, I was actually on pace to hit around 3 hours (according to my friend). In my head, I made that a very, very soft goal.\n\nAs we progress on the boardwalk, at mile 9, my right calf went into the worst cramp I ever felt. So much so that runners behind us stopped and asked if I was okay because they \"never saw someone cramp like that before.\" I honestly don't think I even heard them. But in my head, I kept reminding myself: \"One step forward.\" So we keep going. Mile 10, my left calf goes. Now I'm really starting to doubt everything. \"Can I do this? Why am I falling apart?\" But again, just kept reminding myself mentally and verbally: \"One step forward.\" Mile 11 if I recall correctly was the turn-around on the boardwalk for those doing the half-marathon. I started crying here. Seeing the building where the finish line was just gave that sense of belief. No matter what, I was going to cross that finish line.\n\nMile 12. My left hamstring cramps. My friend is joking to me: \"Don't make it four babies.\" I joke to her: \"I have to stop getting JFKed.\" But again, in my head, no matter what, I was going to cross that finish line.\n\nMile Close to the Finish. I see my fiancee, our best friends, my family, and I just muster whatever energy I can to run. Our one friend who was spectating ran a bit with us to get me to keep going; My goodness, the groups of people near that finish line cheering non-stop filled that battery all over again.\n\nI cross that finish line with my friend and I just start crying. That release and sense of accomplishment is something I will never, ever, ever forget. We go to pick up our medals and I remember hugging the lady and bawling my eyes out. She just kept telling me: \"You did it.\" My friend and I walk up to the PR bell and she tells me to ring it: \"The first of many.\"\n\n### Post-Race\nPost-Race, we're all just there together taking pictures, laughing, and just recounting the actual race experience.\n\nSeeing everyone there; Just made my heart very full.\n\nI couldn't eat any bagels there because I just was not hungry at all. We eventually went to a breakfast spot and I ate my heart out.\n\n### Conclusion\nI have a couple races already scheduled for next year; My friend is aiming to prepare me for the NYC Marathon in CY2026. Looks so amazing. But now, the training continues. I've taken a couple weeks off since the half but I'm excited to get back into gear.", "author_fullname": "t2_l27cdfr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Race Report: My First Half-Marathon!", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "linkflair-racereport", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1gkbn9f", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Race Report", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1730826472.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.running", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Race Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; Atlantic City Half Marathon&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; October 20, 2024&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance:&lt;/strong&gt; 13.1 Miles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Atlantic City, NJ&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.acraceseries.com/\"&gt;https://www.acraceseries.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 3:42:04&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Goal&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Completed?&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Finish&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Sub 3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Splits&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Mile&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;13:20&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;13:27&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;15:32&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;14:56&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;14:20&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;15:02&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;15:35&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;15:21&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;15:37&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;16:58&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;24:44&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;21:11&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;23:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some context, in my mid-twenties, I made it a goal/bucket list item/thirty-by-thirty goal to run a race a year (5k, 10k, half, full, etc) leading up to my 30th birthday.

Our one friend who was spectating ran a bit with us to get me to keep going; My goodness, the groups of people near that finish line cheering non-stop filled that battery all over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cross that finish line with my friend and I just start crying. That release and sense of accomplishment is something I will never, ever, ever forget. We go to pick up our medals and I remember hugging the lady and bawling my eyes out. She just kept telling me: &amp;quot;You did it.&amp;quot; My friend and I walk up to the PR bell and she tells me to ring it: &amp;quot;The first of many.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Post-Race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post-Race, we&amp;#39;re all just there together taking pictures, laughing, and just recounting the actual race experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing everyone there; Just made my heart very full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t eat any bagels there because I just was not hungry at all. We eventually went to a breakfast spot and I ate my heart out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a couple races already scheduled for next year; My friend is aiming to prepare me for the NYC Marathon in CY2026. Looks so amazing. But now, the training continues. I&amp;#39;ve taken a couple weeks off since the half but I&amp;#39;m excited to get back into gear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "941b9770-3f38-11e3-b90c-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0dd3bb", "id": "1gkbn9f", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "su4rman", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/running/comments/1gkbn9f/race_report_my_first_halfmarathon/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1gkbn9f/race_report_my_first_halfmarathon/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3688140, "created_utc": 1730826472.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "running", "selftext": "Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

Running a marathon has always been on my bucket list, but I knew running one would require a lot of time to prepare and life would be unpredictable post-child so I thought I should just go for it. When I felt the sudden inspiration in July to run one, I realised the 16 weeks I had before the Auckland Marathon was just enough time to get in a marathon prep training block. In terms of background, I\u2019ve played sports basically my whole life and have always prioritised staying active and fit. I did alright in high school cross country, but hadn\u2019t done any distance running in 16 years and the longest run from back then was a one-off 16km as a teenager.\n\n**Training**\n\nAfter doing a bit of a research, I programmed my own training which consisted of 5 runs a week (2 or 3 easy runs of various distances, 1 or 2 speed/tempo runs, 1 long run). I planned my training in 4-week blocks, building up volume and intensity with mini peak weeks at the end of each one, with my biggest peak week at the end being 75km before doing a 3-week taper. I did two long runs over 30km (30km and 36km).\n\nI ran into a few hurdles along the way, mainly two bouts of flu that took me out of training for 5 days and 2 weeks and caught covid during my peak week (which I mainly ran through as I didn\u2019t test positive till the end and thought it was just a cold). This delayed my 36km long run by half a week and reduced my taper from 3 weeks to 2.5 weeks.\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nI felt like a kid again honestly the whole week leading up to the race on Sunday. It was difficult to focus on other things and I definitely felt the taper crazies a little bit where I kept wondering if I was feeling as \u201cfresh\u201d as I should be feeling, and if I was getting enough sleep etc. It\u2019s quite rare in life to feel that mixture of excitement, anxiety and nerves, and I just tried to enjoy the mixed emotions.\n\nOn Friday I started carb-loading and did this through to Saturday night before the race. I aimed for 700+ grams of carbs a day (I weigh 73kg), which was quite a lot of carbs. I felt bloated, sluggish and full the whole 2 days, and I definitely doubted whether or not this was truly a good idea. I decided to avoid stepping on the scales because I knew between all the carbs and hydration, I was going to be holding onto a lot more water weight than usual and I didn\u2019t want to psych myself out.\n\nThe night before the race I barely got any sleep (there was a party next door and people were letting off fireworks as well), but I woke up at 2:45am on race morning feeling pumped and ready to go. I managed to go to the bathroom 3 times pre-race between my house, the ferry and the porta-loos and by the time I got to the start line I didn\u2019t feel any bloating or fullness at all, I felt primed and ready to go and give it everything.\n\n**Race**\n\nI set my A goal as 3:20, but I actually planned out my race for a 3:15 to be slightly ambitious and to give myself a bit of buffer. The overall plan was to make my first 5km my slowest so I could warm up, and then to speed up over the course of the race so that I would negative split and finish strong. I shot out from the start line too fast (which seems to be an issue for everyone), but I reigned the pace back and managed to stay within a few seconds of my planned pace.\n\nI found the marathon paces extremely enjoyable, because they felt far more sustainable and \u201ccruisy\u201d compared to paces when trying to PB a half marathon or a 10k. The pace, the energy from all the runners around me, and the fresh running environment made the kilometers just fly by. I was laser focused on staying at or just under my planned paces, and aside from that I just enjoyed the scenery and generally just enjoyed running alongside other people (compared to my training which was run pretty much always alone).\n\nThe first tricky part of the Auckland Marathon is crossing the harbour bridge around the 15km point, which is an incline which feels like forever, and there were some serious winds whipping around as well. They even incentivised burning yourself out because they offer prizes for the fastest finisher (every 30min) up the 1km incline. There was a lot of huddling around and trying to use other runners as wind breakers, and I was no different as I slowed my pace down by about 30s and just tried to get through the bridge without expending too much energy.\n\nThe Auckland Marathon has some hills in the first half, and it peaks with the bridge. After the halfway point, it\u2019s basically completely flat along the waterfront, which is a challenge in its own way. As I ran through the halfway point (which was through the actual city), there were more crowds, and the extra cheering got everyone a little excited. I remember looking at my watch and I was somehow going 15s faster than I thought I was going and everything felt fine. Still, I tried to stay disciplined and slowed myself down to save gas in the tank for the rest of the race to come.\n\nAt the 29km point, I saw my wife and my friends who had come to support and that gave me a serious energy boost. This was much needed because the turnaround point at 31km (that would take me back to the city to finish) felt like it would never come and those 2km actually felt like the longest stretch from the whole marathon. After the turnaround point, the saying I\u2019ve read so many times came to mind \u201cthe marathon is a 32km warm up, for a 10km race\u201d. This was especially true because after the turnaround, we started running into headwinds that just continuously sapped energy from my legs that already had started feeling pretty sapped.\n\nNevertheless, I stuck to my planned paces, and in the last 10km I just continuously passed other runners as I stuck to my negative split plan, and I think other runners seemed to be getting slowed right down by the wind. I started seeing people bonk/cramp out left and right, at some point I saw someone projectile vomiting on my left, and it started creating some doubts in my mind about whether or not my body would be able to hold up and avoid cramping as well.\n\nIn my original plan I was going to try speed up in the last 5km and begin my full send and start emptying the tank, but after doing a quick condition check on myself, I assessed that the wind had taken a lot out of me and I pivoted my plan to just hang on at a reasonable pace till the last km before starting to go all out. I ran the last km with pure willpower as my legs were almost completely gone, but I managed to stay upright and run my fastest km at 4:16/km pace to cross the finish line.\n\nA silly mental exercise I did in the last 4-5km was thinking to myself that this is part of the marathon that I would want to watch on TV usually, where the full display of struggle, emotions, competition and just leaving it all out there happens. I thought to myself, \u201cIf this recorded and my son watched this back later, what kind of marathon finisher do I want to be?\u201d, and that gave me quite a boost to just stick with it and out-race the people around me.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nAs soon as I stepped over the line my legs seized up and I could barely walk. I stumbled to the hydration station and downed a few cups of electrolytes, chatted with my wife/friends for a bit and then limped slowly to collect my things. Managed to have enough energy to walk the dogs later in the day, but apart from that basically did nothing and all movements involving my legs have been very painful since then (it\u2019s been 3 days since).\n\nOverall, it was the one of the best sporting events I\u2019ve ever been a part of! I loved the entire experience from learning about running, to preparing and executing my training, to the jitters of race week, to the actual race alongside thousands of other people striving to push themselves to their limits. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll do another one because the training demands are so time consuming, but I\u2019m definitely keen to see if I can keep improving my 5k and 10k times. I\u2019m proud of my finish time and will fondly remember my first marathon as one of the best moments in my life.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you might be interested in the video on YT I made to document my marathon weekend \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\"My First Marathon in 3:16 (whole weekend vlog) - Elimsbored\"", "author_fullname": "t2_lixk2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "My First Marathon ticked off the Bucket List (Auckland Marathon 2024)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "linkflair-racereport", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1gkh256", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 77, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Race Report", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 77, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1730840071.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.running", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading these race reports during my marathon prep, so thought I&amp;#39;d have a go at writing my own \ud83d\ude01&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Auckland Marathon&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a03 November 2024&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a042.2km&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Auckland, NZ&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a03:16:25&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goal A - 3:20&lt;br/&gt;\nGoal B - 3:30&lt;br/&gt;\nGoal C - 3:40\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;KM - Pace (min/km)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 - 4:49&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 - 4:48&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 - 4:51&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 - 4:51&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 - 4:52&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6 - 4:40&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 - 4:42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8 - 4:42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9 - 4:40&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 - 4:42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11 - 4:39&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12 - 4:38&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13 - 4:42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14 - 4:38&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15 - 4:42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16 - 4:54&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17 - 4:32&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18 - 4:28&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;19 - 4:33&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20 - 4:34&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;21 - 4:25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;22 - 4:25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;23 - 4:33&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24 - 4:30&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25 - 4:34&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;26 - 4:32&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;27 - 4:34&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;28 - 4:33&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;29 - 4:29&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30 - 4:31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;31 - 4:31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;32 - 4:33&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;33 - 4:29&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;34 - 4:34&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;35 - 4:31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;36 - 4:39&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;37 - 4:40&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;38 - 4:39&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;39 - 4:36&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;40 - 4:39&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;41 - 4:40&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;42 - 4:16&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I (M32) signed up for the Auckland Marathon in early July 2024, on a bit of a whim after finding out that my wife and I were expecting our first child.

I stumbled to the hydration station and downed a few cups of electrolytes, chatted with my wife/friends for a bit and then limped slowly to collect my things. Managed to have enough energy to walk the dogs later in the day, but apart from that basically did nothing and all movements involving my legs have been very painful since then (it\u2019s been 3 days since).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was the one of the best sporting events I\u2019ve ever been a part of! I loved the entire experience from learning about running, to preparing and executing my training, to the jitters of race week, to the actual race alongside thousands of other people striving to push themselves to their limits. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll do another one because the training demands are so time consuming, but I\u2019m definitely keen to see if I can keep improving my 5k and 10k times. I\u2019m proud of my finish time and will fondly remember my first marathon as one of the best moments in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve read this far, you might be interested in the video on YT I made to document my marathon weekend \ud83d\ude0a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My First Marathon in 3:16 (whole weekend vlog) - Elimsbored&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "941b9770-3f38-11e3-b90c-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0dd3bb", "id": "1gkh256", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Elimsbored", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 14, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/running/comments/1gkh256/my_first_marathon_ticked_off_the_bucket_list/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1gkh256/my_first_marathon_ticked_off_the_bucket_list/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3688140, "created_utc": 1730840071.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "running", "selftext": "I run 30-50 km per week (typically 5 or 10 km runs, the occasional half marathon) and I've been using the Runkeeper app for more than a decade.

I ran the same half last year and took some time off afterwards to reset and running outdoors in New England during winter is not the most fun.\n\nEarly Q1-Early Q2 was regaining my endurance and getting my pace down for 7 mi runs which were my go-to. Since there was more elevation during my training runs, I'd take it a few notches slower. My goal was to get to low 7:10s, always running negative splits because I live on a hill haha. I'd sprinkle in various speed sessions: initially 4 mi sub-7 and keep going as low as I can go. (I think I got down to ~6:38 pace...which is funny because I basically finished at that pace). I'd average around 3 runs per week.\n\nEarly Q2-late Q3 was mostly me trying to keep improving in those 4-5 mi and 7 mi intervals with a few long runs and hill sprints sprinkled in. Usually did 3-4 runs per week combined with some cross training (namely biking). This stretch was tough because I had several travel obligations and no sooner did I feel like I hit a benchmark then I was traveling again. The \"on-again, off-again\" definitely messed with my training, but I was good about doing at least one run wherever I was traveling. This provided some nice views--and definitely some places to avoid--and allowed me to not lose too much ground.\n\nLate Q4-Race Day involved me ramping up my milage and adding a 10 mile long run every weekend. The long run happened to be on most of the course, which allowed me to plan my approach carefully and build up muscle memory (literally). This was one of the best things I did in my training plan and I really wished I did it sooner. Over the next 5-7 weeks I brought my pace for 10 mi down almost a minute (~7:45 min/mi to 6:53 min/mi). At this point, I knew I could do the 1/2. In the 2-3 weeks prior I did a taper, which meant giving myself more time to rest and recover. I brought down the intensity, length (no more than 5-6 mi), and frequency of my runs (2-3x per week).\n\n### Pre-race\nI actually slept decently (7ish hrs) and was up only once during the middle of the night. Definitely benefitted from day light savings time.\n\nI wasn't too nervous, except I left the house later than desired and did not have time to stretch enough and (most importantly) for the usual 2nd bathroom run. I awkwardly tried to stretch in my corral, but was worried with the cold and brevity that it'd bite me in the ass. (Spoiler: it didn't.) Also worth noting it was COLD. 32 degrees to start. It felt like forever for the race to start as I was shivering in my shorts and t-shirt.\n\nMy plan was to go a little over 7 to start, knowing the first mile or so was uphill. I'm a negative splits guy so I wasn't worried about making up the ground.\n\n### Race\n\nMiles 1-3\nThe first mile had me nervous. My HR was 171, which was high. Usually for the initial mile or two it'd be in the high 150s or 160s before creeping into the 170s later on. I was thinking about the doomsday scenario of DNF-ing, something I've never done in my running career. Ultimately finished in sub-7 pace, faster than expected. HR wasn't going down...but I kept going and brought my intensity down a bit. I held steady for mile 2, but with a pretty large hill...my HR spiked again to 174, which raised the caution meter too. I slowed down a bit for mile two, but I knew it was mostly flat (or downhill) from here on out. If I could get to 5k it was just 10 miles--something I've done plenty.\n\nI did get to 5k and felt a bit bouncy, so pushed forward with a burst across the bridge into Allston.\n\nMiles 4-8\n\nMostly were doldrum miles of the race with the exception of running through Harvard Stadium and across the bridge, full of cheering fans, right next to the stadium. By around 6 miles, I felt I hit a wall. My breathing wasn't great, still thinking about my HR which had climbed slightly to 177. If I couldn't bring it down, I may have to slow down to let it reset. I desperately did not want to DNF. I kept my eyes away from my watch, looking ahead and concentrating on diaphragmatic breathing. I focused on breathing through my nose, which was something I read was helpful during cold races. This may be a farce/placebo affect...but I was willing to do nearly anything that'd help.\n\nI had the momentum to get through 8 miles at record-setting pace for me. After reaching mile 8, which ended on an up-hill IIRC, I knew there was only one hill to go near the end. A PR was almost a given, but hitting one of my stretch goals was more a reality than ever.\n\nMiles 9-12.5\n\nOnce I hit Memorial Drive, it's a straightaway to the end...some 3ish miles away. I may have hit the gas too soon and ran it at 6:22. Counterpoint: the crowd was giving great energy and gave me the boost to run that fast. Either way, I reeled myself in and kept pushing forward, looking for groups to stick to (and pass). I reached the last big up-hill and was surprised how little impact the hill had on me. Others faded as I pushed through and that goes to show the power of hill work! \n\nMy biggest obstacle was complete, but there was still a race to complete. My legs could still get wobbly. They did. My breathing could get more labored. It also did.\n\nSomehow I pulled out a 6:20 (and then a 6:14) out of my ass, but I think that's mostly thanks to the downhill.\n\nMiles 12.5-13.1\n\nAt this point, I had picked off dozens of people and it became a game to see how many people I could catch. I recognize that it could come across as arrogant, which to some extent it is, but I also needed to distract myself from the tightening in my legs. I saw the US Flag in the distance which was at the finish line. I told myself \"it's just a sprint to the finish\". Well, it was a long sprint but I did it. I was powered up by the cheers I could hear from my friends and my dad, who I later learned started filming my finish two minutes prior to me approaching so he wouldn't miss my finish on camera.\n\nI saw my time just over 1:27 when I finished, which blew away my previous PR (1:34 high)--a PR I posted on this very course a year ago. When I got my unofficial results, I learned my time was nearly 30 seconds faster due to the staggered start. I was stunned regardless.\n\n### Post-race\nMonths of hard work paid off. This was easily the most dedicated I've ever been about running, including in high school. I was so stunned that I absolutely crushed my PR. I expected a faster time, but I did not expect by this degree.\n\nWith some more training and the same diligence, I'm confident I can bring my time down even more and qualify for a marathon. By the end of the day, I was googling NYC Marathon qualification standards and saw what I was up against. 1:21:00 a number that is far enough away where it scares me a bit. That kind of discomfort would've caused me to shy away from the opportunity earlier in my life. Now I jump into those opportunities more willingly.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.", "author_fullname": "t2_cree7", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Race Report: 2024 Cambridgeside Half Marathon", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "linkflair-racereport", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1gjtobh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Race Report", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1730765835.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.running", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Race Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; Cambridgeside Half Marathon&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; November 3, 2024&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance:&lt;/strong&gt; 13.1 miles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Cambridge, MA&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://runsignup.com/Race/MA/Cambridge/CambridgeHalfMarathon\"&gt;https://runsignup.com/Race/MA/Cambridge/CambridgeHalfMarathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 1:26:XX&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Goal&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Completed?&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:22 avg. mi&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:40 avg. mi&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;sub-7:00 avg. mi&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Splits&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Mile&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:55&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:57&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:47&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:35&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:41&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:46&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:43&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:40&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:35&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:22&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:30&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:20&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6:14&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5:42&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been diligently training since February this year. I ran the same half last year and took some time off afterwards to reset and running outdoors in New England during winter is not the most fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early Q1-Early Q2 was regaining my endurance and getting my pace down for 7 mi runs which were my go-to. Since there was more elevation during my training runs, I&amp;#39;d take it a few notches slower. My goal was to get to low 7:10s, always running negative splits because I live on a hill haha. I&amp;#39;d sprinkle in various speed sessions: initially 4 mi sub-7 and keep going as low as I can go. (I think I got down to ~6:38 pace...which is funny because I basically finished at that pace). I&amp;#39;d average around 3 runs per week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early Q2-late Q3 was mostly me trying to keep improving in those 4-5 mi and 7 mi intervals with a few long runs and hill sprints sprinkled in. Usually did 3-4 runs per week combined with some cross training (namely biking). This stretch was tough because I had several travel obligations and no sooner did I feel like I hit a benchmark then I was traveling again. The &amp;quot;on-again, off-again&amp;quot; definitely messed with my training, but I was good about doing at least one run wherever I was traveling. This provided some nice views--and definitely some places to avoid--and allowed me to not lose too much ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Late Q4-Race Day involved me ramping up my milage and adding a 10 mile long run every weekend. The long run happened to be on most of the course, which allowed me to plan my approach carefully and build up muscle memory (literally). This was one of the best things I did in my training plan and I really wished I did it sooner. Over the next 5-7 weeks I brought my pace for 10 mi down almost a minute (~7:45 min/mi to 6:53 min/mi). At this point, I knew I could do the 1/2. In the 2-3 weeks prior I did a taper, which meant giving myself more time to rest and recover. I brought down the intensity, length (no more than 5-6 mi), and frequency of my runs (2-3x per week).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually slept decently (7ish hrs) and was up only once during the middle of the night.

Had an infrequent weight lifting background and not overweight, but otherwise very out of shape. My friend who ran in high school made a plan going from 10-25 MPW and I stuck to it very religously. I ran a 2:17 half in May.\n\nA goal: Sub 2 hour: Yes\n\nB goal: Sub 2:05: Yes\n\nMile 1: 8:57\n\nMile 2: 9:08\n\nMile 3: 9:02\n\nMile 4: 9:04\n\nMile 5: 9:09\n\nMile 6: 9:07\n\nMile 7: 9:09\n\nMile 8: 9:10\n\nMile 9: 9:02\n\nMile 10: 9:09\n\nMile 11: 9:10\n\nMile 12: 9:09\n\nMile 13: 8:39\n\nSummer Training: After the race I took two weeks off just doing movement for fun. Even coming back to running after that it felt rough. I ran for fun without a plan until mid June, where I started doing easy miles at 20-25 MPW with one speed and one long run per week. I even hit a couple 30 mile weeks. I was definitely feeling the heat, literally doing slower average paces than when I first started back in December. Audiobooks really helped me at this time. I started listening to the Harry Potter Series only when running, which gave me something to look forward to. I tried for a couple PRs (10k at 1:01 and 5k at 28:30) but otherwise couldn't really push the pace. \n\nFall training: This is when I started increasing my MPW to 30 and peaked at 35 running 5-6 days a week. I also did a lot of cross training biking 1x a week, strength training 2x a week, and badminton 2x a week. My 1x a week speed workouts varied a lot; I did fartleks, intervals, tempos, and other random stuff. One thing with my speed workouts though, whenever I tried to do goal half marathon pace (9:05-9:10 per mile) I felt like I was drowning. I couldn't even do mile reps at that pace, let alone a 4-5 mile tempo. My thinking is my shoes, which were just easy day shoes that now had like 400 miles on them each (Asics Gel Kayano and Gel Nimbus) that weren't giving me the energy return. I saw an ad for Saucony Endorphin Pro 2 for $100 off and I got 20% off with a nurse's discount, which meant $95 carbon plated race day shoes! I took them out on one tempo-long run of 10 miles at a 10:00 pace where they felt amazing, but a 9:09 average mile pace still felt pretty far away. There were lots of doubts in my mind, one being that my 5k PB is literally slower than that. However, my garmin race predictor predicted I could run a 1:59 soooo I had something to go off of. Also, side note, I was able to climb a 14er in Colorado in September pretty easily, which made me so happy that running could make so many other things easier too!\n\nRace week: It happened to be a pretty stressful week with it being Halloweekend. So I didn't have the best sleep, but I also held off from drinking too. I drank electrolytes the 4 days leading up to the race and tried to carb load. With daylight savings time and 2 melatonins, I slept for 9 hours the night before the race! \n\nRace morning: I was determined to not make the same mistake as last time of waiting in the long bathroom line then being late to the start with no time to warm up or prepare anything. I woke up at 5am, took a shit, ate toast (whole wheat, which is what I always eat), peanut butter, and bananas. I did some active stretches at home and sipped on some carb+electrolyte drink on the way there. I got there very early, so I was able to use the bathroom no problem, jog, and warm up all I wanted. The weather was perfect for me at 45 degrees. I ate a honey stinger stroop waffle 15 min before starting the race. Literally walking up to the start line I made the decision to go out at sub 2 hour pace and just try to hold it. I'd rather try to sustain and have to cut back than be rushing to make up the time later if I felt good (I know thats not always recommended)\n\nThe race: I did it again, I started out too fast. My 2nd fastest mile was the first one, but that didn't ruin me too much and it gave me some nice wiggle room for pace. Some differences compared to my last half: For this one, there were no pacers, less elevation gain, lots of potholes, less people, colder, and more windy. That meant I was running alone for a couple miles, which was hard, but running was easier. Once I hit a very windy section, I made the person ahead of me my goal to catch up to, which helped a lot. That way, I could just turn my brain off and run with that person (also the wind drafting helped a bit). I didn't carry water this time either, I just timed my gel intake (at 3, 6, and 10 miles) before the water stops that I just took sips at. This race NEVER felt easy, but I just kept listening to my body about whether the pace was getting too much. My legs felt like they weren't even there, but my ankles were uncomfortable since mile 6, I'm guessing it was the shoes and they got to a point in the race around mile 8-10 where I felt like it was almost holding me back. Once I hit 10 miles, I knew I had it in the bag provided I didn't trip on any potholes. I had some energy left in the tank to do a fast 13th mile and a sprint to finish. My friends were able to drive around and cheer me on at 4 points on the course which was so helpful. The course was a little long, which most are, so I was glad I aimed a little faster than an average 9:09. I used my garmin forerunner to keep pace, mostly looking at my average and current paces. Anyway, I did it! I got 1:59:37.\n\nFuture goals: I'm gonna focus more on strength training and the 5k. Gonna try to squat a plate and get sub 25 min. Then, its on to my first marathon in June which I will probably start really training for in February.

San Francisco is a very anti-car city in the best way. I love living here because of that. But when it comes to getting dropped off, there were no solutions. After sitting in traffic, I decided to leave my Uber and walk the last mile to the start.\n\nPre race is where the woes started.\n\nThere were about 10 port o potties for 4500 people. So, I had 0 chance to empty my bladder, making the first bit of the race extremely painful on my lower stomach.\n\nPeople were giving up, peeing into bushes and into the ocean. Lol\n\nRace\n\nThe race itself was gorgeous. Starting off, the crisp Bay Area air was incredible at 6:50AM. First 3 miles were easy. Flat land along the coals of the bay.\n\nMiles 4-6 were hellish. If you\u2019ve been to the Golden Gate Bridge, you know where this is. Hills from the presidio to the bridge itself with 0 relief. It was here I finally had to use a port o potty. Right before I crossed the bridge I had to wait in a 5 minute line to pee. Frustrating, lost my momentum.\n\nThe bridge was also, pretty frustrating. This race is NOT for time, that\u2019s for sure. The bridge itself is not shut down. You are using the pedestrian walkway on the sides of the bridge.\n\nAgain, 4500 people crammed into a lane smaller than a car lane. So many times I had to slow to a walk due to congestion. People started walking without pulling over. Got nearly pushed into a light post a few times with people running 3-4 wide. But, we got through.\n\nI had everything I normally need, a water bottle with salty electrolytes in it, a nutrigrain bar for a burst of energy if needed, and my AirPods.\n\nBut the next miles were the biggest challenges. The water table on the other side of the bridge did not have water, just Prime. That shitty Jake Paul drink.\n\nNever had it? Think the most potent lemonade you\u2019ve ever had with coconut water.\n\nI went from my salty electrolyte drink to an even saltier and sweeter cup of lemonade and I spat it out.\n\nMy stomach churned. I was 7 miles in and about to vomit. Exhaustion and dehydration set in. The Prime was so horrible. I held it in and kept going.\n\nLuckily, after returning from the bridge, it was all down hill from there. Literally. Miles 8-10 were all down hill with (THANK GOD) real water stations. Myself and other runners were chugging cups of water and spitting the taste of prime out of our mouths.\n\nHow that one table had only prime was unreal.\n\nMile 10.5 I hit my wall. Every song on my playlist pissed me off, spectators were even pissing me off. I was hangry. My jog was slower than my walk, but I was back on the flat coastal trail. I dug into my nutrigrain bar as my taste buds winced at the sugar and my stomach turned. But I needed the energy.\n\nAfter swallowing, I felt amazing a minute later. My head was clear, my thoughts were positive.

San Francisco is a very anti-car city in the best way. I love living here because of that. But when it comes to getting dropped off, there were no solutions. After sitting in traffic, I decided to leave my Uber and walk the last mile to the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pre race is where the woes started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were about 10 port o potties for 4500 people. So, I had 0 chance to empty my bladder, making the first bit of the race extremely painful on my lower stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People were giving up, peeing into bushes and into the ocean. Lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Race&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The race itself was gorgeous. Starting off, the crisp Bay Area air was incredible at 6:50AM. First 3 miles were easy. Flat land along the coals of the bay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miles 4-6 were hellish. If you\u2019ve been to the Golden Gate Bridge, you know where this is. Hills from the presidio to the bridge itself with 0 relief. It was here I finally had to use a port o potty. Right before I crossed the bridge I had to wait in a 5 minute line to pee. Frustrating, lost my momentum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bridge was also, pretty frustrating. This race is NOT for time, that\u2019s for sure. The bridge itself is not shut down. You are using the pedestrian walkway on the sides of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, 4500 people crammed into a lane smaller than a car lane. So many times I had to slow to a walk due to congestion. People started walking without pulling over. Got nearly pushed into a light post a few times with people running 3-4 wide. But, we got through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had everything I normally need, a water bottle with salty electrolytes in it, a nutrigrain bar for a burst of energy if needed, and my AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the next miles were the biggest challenges. The water table on the other side of the bridge did not have water, just Prime. That shitty Jake Paul drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never had it? Think the most potent lemonade you\u2019ve ever had with coconut water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went from my salty electrolyte drink to an even saltier and sweeter cup of lemonade and I spat it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach churned. I was 7 miles in and about to vomit. Exhaustion and dehydration set in. The Prime was so horrible. I held it in and kept going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, after returning from the bridge, it was all down hill from there. Literally. Miles 8-10 were all down hill with (THANK GOD) real water stations. Myself and other runners were chugging cups of water and spitting the taste of prime out of our mouths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How that one table had only prime was unreal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mile 10.5 I hit my wall. Every song on my playlist pissed me off, spectators were even pissing me off. I was hangry. My jog was slower than my walk, but I was back on the flat coastal trail. I dug into my nutrigrain bar as my taste buds winced at the sugar and my stomach turned. But I needed the energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After swallowing, I felt amazing a minute later. My head was clear, my thoughts were positive. I had energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finished off my very dehydrated and exhausting first 13.1. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post-race\nI was SO EXHAUSTED and SO TIRED I didn\u2019t even get a post workout beer.

Graduated college two years ago and didn\u2019t change that lifestyle until I picked up running (huge for my personal life and thankful for my health to be able to do this). Started running in May 2024 with the intention of running the marathon, today. With various  5k races here and there (21:59 PR) I ended up having an unexpected major surgery August 26th. Through July, I was at 25-30 MPW and was about to get into the heat of the marathon build and had to make the decision to cancel the marathon because of the surgery. \n\nHad the surgery and was unable to run, lift, or do any cardio for four weeks. Spent the last bit of September and October preparing for the half marathon, getting about 25 MPW. Probably overly ambitious goal of 1:45 - 1:40 but that\u2019s where my vDOT had me and I thought I had the fitness. This was my first half marathon race. \n\n# Race\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nPoor planning, but Friday night was spent at the Taylor Swift concert w my wonderful wife - ended up on my feet for 4 hours - obviously not ideal but had a blast. Spent all day Saturday rotting on the couch, drinking water, electrolytes, pb jelly sandwiches and ate pizza for an early dinner. I did not do a shake out run and stopped drinking completely 1 week out. \n\nMorning of, I did my usual- plain oatmeal, maple syrup , and water. \n\n**Plan**\n\nMy plan for the day was to break the race into 4 different 5ks. Aimed for 8 min pace the first 5k, 7:50 min pace for second 5k, 7:50 for third 5k, and 7:40 for the fourth 5k. \n\n**Race**\n\nRight before the gun, I had my first gel since it had been ~ 2 hours since I had the oatmeal. \n\nFirst 5k (Miles 1-3) \nThe race started and I allowed the entire crowd to pass me. The first 2 miles were straight uphill/downhill and I was already thinking about the finish and how brutal that would be since this was an out and back half marathon. Finished the first 5k in great spirits at an 8:00 pace and had my second gel. \n\n\nSecond 5k (Miles 4-6) \nI caught up to the 1:45 pacers right after the first 5k and stayed with the group until it felt borderline fartlek running for two miles. Felt choppy and not super smooth so I blew by the group. Feeling great, rounded out mile 6 and the second 5k at a 7:51 pace. Third gel was taken. \n\nThird 5k (Miles 7-9) \nThings started getting harder after the first two miles of this 5k (Mile 9) and this is where I found the wall. I tried another gel but could not get it down. Mind you, I only have ever had honey combs fruit smoothie gels so now I was taking my fourth and final gel and was gagging trying to get it down. Fought through this 5k with an 8:05 pace. \n\nFourth 5k (Miles 10-12):\nThis was the true pain cave. I could not get my legs moving at an 8:00 pace whatsoever but would not let myself walk. I waddled as fast I could. Once I got to the elevation the race started with, I was toast. The 1:45 pacer group passed me and my confidence was gone. I called my wife on mile 10 that I didn\u2019t have it in me to get sub 1:45 and felt defeated. My hamstrings were tightening completely coming up the hills and couldn\u2019t stride well going down. 9:10 pace. \n\nFinal stretch:\nI emptied the tank and pushed the remaining 0.66 miles at a 8:17 pace. \n\nCrossed the finish line and walked to a grassy area out of the way and collapsed. \n\nFinish time 1:48:12\n\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI was complaining to my wife that the race didn\u2019t serve Gatorade or bananas after the race. I saw chips, pie, water, oranges, and beer. Bugged me to death since I could hardly stand at this point.\n\n I just got home, showered, and put on my \u201crot on the couch\u201d clothes and will not move. The theragun and foam roller will get their use today in between rot sessions \n\n\n\n# Reflection\n\nI did not negative split like I wanted and it\u2019s brutal to be passed the final 5 miles. In 5ks, I always have a negative split so it wasn\u2019t fun being on this side of it.\n\nDo I think my fitness is there for a 1:45? Yes. I attribute the failed goal by the final up hill 3 miles and one brutal half mile stretch that was elevation I\u2019ve never done before. \n\nGagging for a half mile on mile 9 because of the gel taste did not help either. Next time, I need to get variety in my gel selection. \n\n\n# Whats Next\n\nI have a marathon booked in Louisville again in April 2025 so base building and then a full marathon block come 2025.

Graduated college two years ago and didn\u2019t change that lifestyle until I picked up running (huge for my personal life and thankful for my health to be able to do this). Started running in May 2024 with the intention of running the marathon, today. With various  5k races here and there (21:59 PR) I ended up having an unexpected major surgery August 26th. Through July, I was at 25-30 MPW and was about to get into the heat of the marathon build and had to make the decision to cancel the marathon because of the surgery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had the surgery and was unable to run, lift, or do any cardio for four weeks. Spent the last bit of September and October preparing for the half marathon, getting about 25 MPW. Probably overly ambitious goal of 1:45 - 1:40 but that\u2019s where my vDOT had me and I thought I had the fitness. This was my first half marathon race. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Race&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor planning, but Friday night was spent at the Taylor Swift concert w my wonderful wife - ended up on my feet for 4 hours - obviously not ideal but had a blast. Spent all day Saturday rotting on the couch, drinking water, electrolytes, pb jelly sandwiches and ate pizza for an early dinner. I did not do a shake out run and stopped drinking completely 1 week out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morning of, I did my usual- plain oatmeal, maple syrup , and water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan for the day was to break the race into 4 different 5ks. Aimed for 8 min pace the first 5k, 7:50 min pace for second 5k, 7:50 for third 5k, and 7:40 for the fourth 5k. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right before the gun, I had my first gel since it had been ~ 2 hours since I had the oatmeal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First 5k (Miles 1-3) \nThe race started and I allowed the entire crowd to pass me. The first 2 miles were straight uphill/downhill and I was already thinking about the finish and how brutal that would be since this was an out and back half marathon. Finished the first 5k in great spirits at an 8:00 pace and had my second gel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second 5k (Miles 4-6) \nI caught up to the 1:45 pacers right after the first 5k and stayed with the group until it felt borderline fartlek running for two miles. Felt choppy and not super smooth so I blew by the group. Feeling great, rounded out mile 6 and the second 5k at a 7:51 pace. Third gel was taken. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third 5k (Miles 7-9) \nThings started getting harder after the first two miles of this 5k (Mile 9) and this is where I found the wall. I tried another gel but could not get it down. Mind you, I only have ever had honey combs fruit smoothie gels so now I was taking my fourth and final gel and was gagging trying to get it down. Fought through this 5k with an 8:05 pace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fourth 5k (Miles 10-12):\nThis was the true pain cave. I could not get my legs moving at an 8:00 pace whatsoever but would not let myself walk. I waddled as fast I could. Once I got to the elevation the race started with, I was toast. The 1:45 pacer group passed me and my confidence was gone. I called my wife on mile 10 that I didn\u2019t have it in me to get sub 1:45 and felt defeated. My hamstrings were tightening completely coming up the hills and couldn\u2019t stride well going down. 9:10 pace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final stretch:\nI emptied the tank and pushed the remaining 0.66 miles at a 8:17 pace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crossed the finish line and walked to a grassy area out of the way and collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finish time 1:48:12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was complaining to my wife that the race didn\u2019t serve Gatorade or bananas after the race. I saw chips, pie, water, oranges, and beer. Bugged me to death since I could hardly stand at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just got home, showered, and put on my \u201crot on the couch\u201d clothes and will not move. The theragun and foam roller will get their use today in between rot sessions &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Reflection&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not negative split like I wanted and it\u2019s brutal to be passed the final 5 miles. In 5ks, I always have a negative split so it wasn\u2019t fun being on this side of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I think my fitness is there for a 1:45? Yes. I attribute the failed goal by the final up hill 3 miles and one brutal half mile stretch that was elevation I\u2019ve never done before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gagging for a half mile on mile 9 because of the gel taste did not help either. Next time, I need to get variety in my gel selection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Whats Next&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a marathon booked in Louisville again in April 2025 so base building and then a full marathon block come 2025. Looking to work on 5k training to round this year out and hit some new PRs there as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, not entirely sure.

Thank you, running, for changing my life for the better. \n\n\n\n**Background \u2013What Got Me into Running**\n\nI never had a habit of exercising, nor did I ever aspire to be a runner when I was growing up. I was the overweight kid who dreaded and loathed gym classes. Despite this at that time I didn't consider myself a completely sedentary person (LMAO) cause I always enjoyed walking (made a point to myself that I needed to walk every day, even if it was only for 30 mins when busy) and I had a part-time job on the kitchen at a restaurant, so I never stay still all day long.\n\nFast forward to late 2020 when I got my first full-time office job. Starting a job during Covid lockdown meant I was living in full sedentary mode and after a few months in, I realized how unhealthy this had been as I was on \"wake up-sit from 9-5-doomscrolling-sleep\" mode. So in an attempt to keep myself moving, I started running in 2021. I still remember that first-ever run, I couldn't even run for 1 km without stopping and in total I only ran for 2.92 km. This was a wake-up call for me. My thought was \"I am still in my early 20s and couldn't even run 1 km. Pathetic\".\n\nThereafter I commited to run 3 days a week, and at that time that was hard. I didn't follow a training plan and was just trying to run as far as I could. By the end of 2021, I could finally run a 5k without stopping. In early 2022, my friends asked if I was interested in joining them running a 10.5km/quarter marathon race scheduled in April. 10.5km distance seemed to be a daunting task for me since I never run more than 5k at that point but I said yes anyway cause I thought this could be a motivation to keep the momentum going. Moving on to the race, not only I was really satisfied with my time (managed to run it in exactly 1 hour) but the feeling and atmosphere of a race were indescribable for me. The anticipation at the start line, the cheers from the crowds, the feeling that you can push yourself through the run, the accomplishment you feel at the finish line - all were too great for me. From that moment on, I know I will sign up for more races in the future.\n\n  \nI didn't join any more races in 2022 because I felt like I needed to improve my running before I signed up for more races so I used the remainder of the year to make running part of my routine. Then in early 2023 I finally felt to take it up a notch by signing myself to two races just one month apart: a 10-miler/16km race in September and a half marathon in October. It was also a turning point when I started to take running seriously as I invested in Garmin. By following the built-in training plan in my Garmin, I managed to clock in sub 1.30 in my 16 km race and sub 2 in my first-ever half marathon. I honestly didn't expect that, I would just be satisfied If I could finish my first HM in around 2 hours.\n\n  \nSoon the thoughts of signing up for a marathon entered my mind. For sure I had doubts at myself regarding this, a marathon is a formidable challenge in its own right. After talking to some people at the local run club who had ran one, they encouraged me to sign for it. So in January 2024, I made the decision to sign up.\n\n\n\n**Training**\n\nFirst task is to decide which training plan to follow. I couldn't rely on Garmin anymore as the built-in plan maxed out at HM distance. There are tons of free training plans on the internet such as Hal Higdon's, some from other marathon races, like Copenhagen, London, and Paris. While these training plans are not bad, I found that none of them includes a deload week. At the same time, I kept receiving targeted ads of Runna. After reading reviews about it on the internet and hearing the reviews from my friends, I decided to opt for a Runna plan instead. Looking back, it's worth every penny cause it built an integrated training plan for me. Not only the plan included a deload week each month; it also incorporated strength training, mobility, and pilates. In addition, it also defined the paces for my interval, tempo, and long runs. It also synced automatically on my Garmin so all I need was just to run.\n\nAs this is my first marathon, the plan was to have a 20-week training plan, which means I should start training by the last week of May. Yet this went out of the window because I had a small injury on my adductors before the training block started. Deep down I was panicking because the plan should have started now but I kept telling myself it was better to dial down the running and recover rather than have the issue re-appeared when training was at its peak. So what I did for the first half of June was rehab exercises, strength training, and swimming. I still ran once a week at this period at easy pace for around 5-7km to see how my adductors were doing. On the second half of June it was getting better so I kept my routine but slowly increased my mileage. Finally on second week of July I could jump back on the plan that Runna set for me.\n\nFrom that week until the race week, my week consisted of 3-4x runs, 3x 1 hour of strength training, 1x 30 mins mobility session, 1x 30 mins pilates session, and 1x cross training. Here is the outline of how my week usually went:\n\nMonday: rest day\n\nTuesday: AM strength training, PM easy run\n\nWednesday: AM mobility, PM cross training (until August this was swimming, from September onwards it was outdoor rowing)\n\nThursday: AM strength training, PM tempo/interval run (Runna alternates weekly between both)\n\nFriday: AM pilates, PM recovery run (not every Friday)\n\nSaturday: long run\n\nSunday: strength training\n\nIt was not exactly like this every week but that's the gist.\n\nWhat I did for my easy run was basically zone 2 running. It was not to care about pace but only heart rate, where I aimed to be around 140 bpm and maxing out at 150 bpm when it gets warm and humid. Honestly, it didn't feel so easy at first cause before this I never really committed myself to zone 2 running. This meant I was running usually at pace 7 min/km (even 8 min/km when it was warm, so humbling). But I have learned how to embrace this pace, I just basically lost myself in my own thoughts lol. About the paces for the speedwork, I just need to follow what Runna had set for me, usually around 4.10-4.30 min/km for intervals and 4.45-5.10 min/km for tempo. About the long run, it sets for me to follow marathon pace for some portions of the long run, sometimes it included a 1 km of interval pace, and the rest is on easy pace.\n\n  \nSome say although distance-wise a marathon is twice a half marathon, the training is three times harder, even four. \u00a0It didn\u2019t take me long to realize that is true because I reached my peak mileage when I trained for half marathon within a month of my marathon training. I tried my best to show up and each time the motivation was not there, discipline kicked in and I told myself I should be thankful for each run as there were others who might not have the opportunity to do this. In the end, I missed only 1 long run cause I already had a ticket to a music festival. My peak week was 4 weeks ahead of the race, peaking at 61 km mileage and I did two long runs above 30 km (33.5 km and 31 km) on this training block.\n\nWhen it was finally time to taper, I was so glad that I manage to get through the training. It was a 3-week taper where the mileage decreased 25% and then 50%. I still went for strength training but decreased the intensity (same weights, less sets). In the last week of taper (aka the race week) I did two runs, one of which was a shakeout run one day before the race, one toned-down strength training on Monday to help with the taper tantrum, and outdoor rowing.\n\n\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nAs I never did a proper carb load before, I never imagined how much food I would eat. I was aiming to eat 8-10g of carbs per kg of my body weight for 3 days leading to the race. This meant I would eat 400gr of white rice for lunch and dinner, snacking on bread rolls and jam every hour. I was stuffed. The night before the race, apart from the carb-rich dinner I also downed a 320 Maurten gel mix. I managed to get a relatively good night of sleep, considering how much adrenaline I felt at that point. Woke up at around 6.30, had a breakfast of white toast with jam, a banana, and coffee. After answering the call of nature in the restroom and prepared myself it was time to go. On the way to the Olympic Stadium I downed an electrolyte drink mix and another banana. Here two worlds of Amsterdam collide: the world of sports vs the world of partying, as on the same week there was ADE (Amsterdam Dance Event) where people came to Amsterdam to party. It was funny seeing the metro was packed with runners and those who just finished partying looked hungover and confused about why there were so many runners on Sunday morning. I was proud to be a part of the running world. Arrived at the Olympic Stadium one hour before my start wave started. I expected a long queue at the drop bag but it was okay. It was followed by a last trip to the loo then it was time for warm up. I entered inside the stadium (start area was inside) around 25 mins before my wave started and I felt goosebumps so hard that I wanted to cry, all felt so real. As it was not as cold as expected, there was no need to wear extra layers. Singlet, shorts, and armsleeves were enough already. Around 15 mins before, I downed a Maurten 100 gel and tried to keep moving until it was time.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Race**\n\nPacked with 7 gels and a 650ml bottle filled with electrolytes mix, I crossed the starting line at 9:15. Adrenaline rushed through my body and for the first 2km, I felt good and managed to not start out too fast. At the 2 km mark, as I was running through Vondelpark, reality hits hard that I was running a marathon, 42.2 km of it. It came clear that I need to ran back again to Vondelpark, and I need to ran for the next 40km. I was thinking \"*why I am doing here? I could have chosen to party at ADE with some of my friends but instead I am running a marathon*\". But by the time I ran under Rijkmuseum, those thoughts were gone already and I was back on enjoying the race. Or so I thought.\n\n  \nNot long after the first drink station at 5 km point which I walked by, I was hit by something I never experienced on my whole training block: cramps on my right calf. Deep down I started to panic, thinking that a sub 4 marathon was now unattainable. During my training, I experienced niggles on my knees, hip, adductors, but never on my calf. I also didn't neglect my calf on my strength training, calf raises were on the menu every week. So on km 5-6, I stopped for a bit. Honestly my ego took a hit as well as it seemed that I was the only one who stopped at this point. A kind bystander asked if I was okay and I replied with \"I'm fine, just a little cramp on my calf\". He told me to breathe, stretch, take it easy, trust the training, and enjoy the race. As I felt better and started to walk slowly, the kind stranger wished me luck and gave me a thumbs up. Up until km 11, basically it was a battle to calm my mind down over what had happened and to settle into the race.\n\n  \nWhen the race turned from Churcillaan into Rijnstraat, I spotted my friend from my running club among the bystanders. He wished me luck and we hugged for a bit. Apparently that hug was what I needed, not only it helped to clear my mind and focus back to the race, it also set off the runners\u2019 high. Until km 25, I felt nothing but pure joy and fun. The race didn\u2019t felt as a struggle at all and I was able to steadily increase my pace to make up the time that was lost between km 5-10. This part of the race felt like a piece of cake.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe runner\u2019s high subsided when the course turned around from along the Amstel to Joan Muskeyweg and Van der Madeweg, as I felt that the RPE (rate of perceived exertion) needed to maintain the pace steadily increased. I realized this as although the gap between the drink stations on km 26 and km 31 is shorter than between km 26 and km 20, that 5 km started to feel like an eternity. I realized that I needed to be strategic and not let my mind defeat me, so I broke up the remainder of the race into three different parts: until km 32, km 32-37, and km 37-finish. This allowed me to keep my pace stable as on my mind I was telling myself to get it through until km 32 and not too stressed about the last 10k.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen it was finally 10 km to go, I told myself that finally it was less than an hour to go. I kept telling myself \u201c*you\u2019ve got this. It\u2019s 10 km to go and you\u2019ve run a lot at this distance. 10 km is an easy run so you can definitely nail this*\u201d. It was definitely \u201cmind over matter\u201d mode until the finish line. Some say a marathon is a 32 km warmup and 10 km race, and for me that is true. The RPE that I felt was like running a 10 km race pace although I was running at marathon pace. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the course turned into Weteringcircuit I could feel that it was getting closer, but the underpass near the Weesperplein metro station around km 36 made the finish line seemed far. I know this is a flat race but the climb from that underpass onto the first half of Torontobrug over the Amstel felt *hard*. It felt like I used every bit of my energy to keep running and ignore the voice in my head telling me to stop. Basically I gaslighted myself that I didn\u2019t eat that much of carbs during carb loading to stop here.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI felt a little relieved once I got through the second half of Torontobrug as there was no significant climb until the finish line and it was 5km more on from there. \u201cLess than 30 minutes to go\u201d, I told myself. The run didn\u2019t get easier, but as I downed my last gel and felt the energy from the crowds, I pushed myself until the route turned to Vondelpark.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe sight of the Vondelpark entrance gate was a welcoming sight. It was not the finish line yet but I was proud that I managed to get back here again after running for more than 3,5 hours. The temptation to slow down and stop was also there, but I told myself that I had run in this park multiple times before to keep myself going. Once I exited Vondelpark, it was just basically a straight route until the Olympic Stadium. This was when it became clear that I could still finish within 4 hours if I increased the pace a bit. So with every bit of energy left, I pushed myself so I could finish strong. As I ran as fast as I could, I told myself this was all the interval training was for, the last push. And a push it was, according to the pace chart on my Garmin my pace increased from 5:25 min/km to 4:20 min/km in the last 4 minutes of the race. With that, I crossed the finish line and once I realized that I clocked a sub-4 hour in my first marathon, my eyes were full of tears of happiness.\n\n\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI tried to keep moving after the finish line so I could meet my friends who were waiting outside the stadium but it became clear that I could walk only very slowly. After stretching a bit, having my bag retrieved from the bag drop and my medals engraved, we walked to nearby restaurant to have celebratory burgers and beers. But after that the challenge was to get home, as a lot of public transport access was closed due to the race which means that I need to walk to Amsterdam Zuid station. The distance is only 1,5 km but I was limping to get there.\n\nOn the next few days I was still limping but I forced myself to go for a walk everyday because I know it helped with recovery. I also wore compression socks when I went to sleep for almost a week after the race. It got better every day and I can finally walk up and down the stairs again on the weekend after the race. That being said, I took a complete rest from any sports activities in the first week after the race. I resumed doing sports when I rowed again on Monday (8 days after the race) and my first run back was exactly two weeks after the race. On to the next race!\n\n  \nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.\n\n\u00a0", "author_fullname": "t2_rtuw1xra", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "TCS Amsterdam Marathon 2024 - my first marathon", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/running", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "linkflair-racereport", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1gix7pv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 49, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Race Report", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 49, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1730667872.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.running", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0TCS Amsterdam Marathon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a020 October 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a026.2 miles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Amsterdam, NL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://www.tcsamsterdammarathon.nl/\"&gt;https://www.tcsamsterdammarathon.nl/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a03:59:24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Goal&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Completed?&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Finished&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sub 4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Kilometer&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;28:58&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;58:18&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;01:26:19&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Half Marathon&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;02:00:17&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;02:21:51&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;02:49:34&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;03:18:44&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;03:47:22&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;42.195&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;03:59:24&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a long post, but I want to dedicate it to running as a sport.

By following the built-in training plan in my Garmin, I managed to clock in sub 1.30 in my 16 km race and sub 2 in my first-ever half marathon. I honestly didn&amp;#39;t expect that, I would just be satisfied If I could finish my first HM in around 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon the thoughts of signing up for a marathon entered my mind. For sure I had doubts at myself regarding this, a marathon is a formidable challenge in its own right. After talking to some people at the local run club who had ran one, they encouraged me to sign for it. So in January 2024, I made the decision to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First task is to decide which training plan to follow. I couldn&amp;#39;t rely on Garmin anymore as the built-in plan maxed out at HM distance. There are tons of free training plans on the internet such as Hal Higdon&amp;#39;s, some from other marathon races, like Copenhagen, London, and Paris. While these training plans are not bad, I found that none of them includes a deload week. At the same time, I kept receiving targeted ads of Runna. After reading reviews about it on the internet and hearing the reviews from my friends, I decided to opt for a Runna plan instead. Looking back, it&amp;#39;s worth every penny cause it built an integrated training plan for me. Not only the plan included a deload week each month; it also incorporated strength training, mobility, and pilates. In addition, it also defined the paces for my interval, tempo, and long runs. It also synced automatically on my Garmin so all I need was just to run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As this is my first marathon, the plan was to have a 20-week training plan, which means I should start training by the last week of May. Yet this went out of the window because I had a small injury on my adductors before the training block started. Deep down I was panicking because the plan should have started now but I kept telling myself it was better to dial down the running and recover rather than have the issue re-appeared when training was at its peak. So what I did for the first half of June was rehab exercises, strength training, and swimming. I still ran once a week at this period at easy pace for around 5-7km to see how my adductors were doing. On the second half of June it was getting better so I kept my routine but slowly increased my mileage. Finally on second week of July I could jump back on the plan that Runna set for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From that week until the race week, my week consisted of 3-4x runs, 3x 1 hour of strength training, 1x 30 mins mobility session, 1x 30 mins pilates session, and 1x cross training. Here is the outline of how my week usually went:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monday: rest day&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuesday: AM strength training, PM easy run&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday: AM mobility, PM cross training (until August this was swimming, from September onwards it was outdoor rowing)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thursday: AM strength training, PM tempo/interval run (Runna alternates weekly between both)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday: AM pilates, PM recovery run (not every Friday)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday: long run&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday: strength training&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was not exactly like this every week but that&amp;#39;s the gist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I did for my easy run was basically zone 2 running. It was not to care about pace but only heart rate, where I aimed to be around 140 bpm and maxing out at 150 bpm when it gets warm and humid. Honestly, it didn&amp;#39;t feel so easy at first cause before this I never really committed myself to zone 2 running. This meant I was running usually at pace 7 min/km (even 8 min/km when it was warm, so humbling). But I have learned how to embrace this pace, I just basically lost myself in my own thoughts lol. About the paces for the speedwork, I just need to follow what Runna had set for me, usually around 4.10-4.30 min/km for intervals and 4.45-5.10 min/km for tempo. About the long run, it sets for me to follow marathon pace for some portions of the long run, sometimes it included a 1 km of interval pace, and the rest is on easy pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some say although distance-wise a marathon is twice a half marathon, the training is three times harder, even four. \u00a0It didn\u2019t take me long to realize that is true because I reached my peak mileage when I trained for half marathon within a month of my marathon training. I tried my best to show up and each time the motivation was not there, discipline kicked in and I told myself I should be thankful for each run as there were others who might not have the opportunity to do this. In the end, I missed only 1 long run cause I already had a ticket to a music festival. My peak week was 4 weeks ahead of the race, peaking at 61 km mileage and I did two long runs above 30 km (33.5 km and 31 km) on this training block.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it was finally time to taper, I was so glad that I manage to get through the training. It was a 3-week taper where the mileage decreased 25% and then 50%. I still went for strength training but decreased the intensity (same weights, less sets). In the last week of taper (aka the race week) I did two runs, one of which was a shakeout run one day before the race, one toned-down strength training on Monday to help with the taper tantrum, and outdoor rowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I never did a proper carb load before, I never imagined how much food I would eat. I was aiming to eat 8-10g of carbs per kg of my body weight for 3 days leading to the race. This meant I would eat 400gr of white rice for lunch and dinner, snacking on bread rolls and jam every hour. I was stuffed. The night before the race, apart from the carb-rich dinner I also downed a 320 Maurten gel mix. I managed to get a relatively good night of sleep, considering how much adrenaline I felt at that point. Woke up at around 6.30, had a breakfast of white toast with jam, a banana, and coffee. After answering the call of nature in the restroom and prepared myself it was time to go. On the way to the Olympic Stadium I downed an electrolyte drink mix and another banana. Here two worlds of Amsterdam collide: the world of sports vs the world of partying, as on the same week there was ADE (Amsterdam Dance Event) where people came to Amsterdam to party. It was funny seeing the metro was packed with runners and those who just finished partying looked hungover and confused about why there were so many runners on Sunday morning. I was proud to be a part of the running world. Arrived at the Olympic Stadium one hour before my start wave started. I expected a long queue at the drop bag but it was okay. It was followed by a last trip to the loo then it was time for warm up. I entered inside the stadium (start area was inside) around 25 mins before my wave started and I felt goosebumps so hard that I wanted to cry, all felt so real. As it was not as cold as expected, there was no need to wear extra layers. Singlet, shorts, and armsleeves were enough already. Around 15 mins before, I downed a Maurten 100 gel and tried to keep moving until it was time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Packed with 7 gels and a 650ml bottle filled with electrolytes mix, I crossed the starting line at 9:15. Adrenaline rushed through my body and for the first 2km, I felt good and managed to not start out too fast. At the 2 km mark, as I was running through Vondelpark, reality hits hard that I was running a marathon, 42.2 km of it. It came clear that I need to ran back again to Vondelpark, and I need to ran for the next 40km. I was thinking &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;why I am doing here? I could have chosen to party at ADE with some of my friends but instead I am running a marathon&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. But by the time I ran under Rijkmuseum, those thoughts were gone already and I was back on enjoying the race. Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not long after the first drink station at 5 km point which I walked by, I was hit by something I never experienced on my whole training block: cramps on my right calf. Deep down I started to panic, thinking that a sub 4 marathon was now unattainable. During my training, I experienced niggles on my knees, hip, adductors, but never on my calf. I also didn&amp;#39;t neglect my calf on my strength training, calf raises were on the menu every week. So on km 5-6, I stopped for a bit. Honestly my ego took a hit as well as it seemed that I was the only one who stopped at this point. A kind bystander asked if I was okay and I replied with &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine, just a little cramp on my calf&amp;quot;. He told me to breathe, stretch, take it easy, trust the training, and enjoy the race. As I felt better and started to walk slowly, the kind stranger wished me luck and gave me a thumbs up. Up until km 11, basically it was a battle to calm my mind down over what had happened and to settle into the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the race turned from Churcillaan into Rijnstraat, I spotted my friend from my running club among the bystanders. He wished me luck and we hugged for a bit. Apparently that hug was what I needed, not only it helped to clear my mind and focus back to the race, it also set off the runners\u2019 high. Until km 25, I felt nothing but pure joy and fun. The race didn\u2019t felt as a struggle at all and I was able to steadily increase my pace to make up the time that was lost between km 5-10. This part of the race felt like a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The runner\u2019s high subsided when the course turned around from along the Amstel to Joan Muskeyweg and Van der Madeweg, as I felt that the RPE (rate of perceived exertion) needed to maintain the pace steadily increased. I realized this as although the gap between the drink stations on km 26 and km 31 is shorter than between km 26 and km 20, that 5 km started to feel like an eternity. I realized that I needed to be strategic and not let my mind defeat me, so I broke up the remainder of the race into three different parts: until km 32, km 32-37, and km 37-finish. This allowed me to keep my pace stable as on my mind I was telling myself to get it through until km 32 and not too stressed about the last 10k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it was finally 10 km to go, I told myself that finally it was less than an hour to go. I kept telling myself \u201c&lt;em&gt;you\u2019ve got this. It\u2019s 10 km to go and you\u2019ve run a lot at this distance. 10 km is an easy run so you can definitely nail this&lt;/em&gt;\u201d. It was definitely \u201cmind over matter\u201d mode until the finish line. Some say a marathon is a 32 km warmup and 10 km race, and for me that is true. The RPE that I felt was like running a 10 km race pace although I was running at marathon pace. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the course turned into Weteringcircuit I could feel that it was getting closer, but the underpass near the Weesperplein metro station around km 36 made the finish line seemed far. I know this is a flat race but the climb from that underpass onto the first half of Torontobrug over the Amstel felt &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. It felt like I used every bit of my energy to keep running and ignore the voice in my head telling me to stop. Basically I gaslighted myself that I didn\u2019t eat that much of carbs during carb loading to stop here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a little relieved once I got through the second half of Torontobrug as there was no significant climb until the finish line and it was 5km more on from there. \u201cLess than 30 minutes to go\u201d, I told myself. The run didn\u2019t get easier, but as I downed my last gel and felt the energy from the crowds, I pushed myself until the route turned to Vondelpark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sight of the Vondelpark entrance gate was a welcoming sight. It was not the finish line yet but I was proud that I managed to get back here again after running for more than 3,5 hours. The temptation to slow down and stop was also there, but I told myself that I had run in this park multiple times before to keep myself going. Once I exited Vondelpark, it was just basically a straight route until the Olympic Stadium. This was when it became clear that I could still finish within 4 hours if I increased the pace a bit. So with every bit of energy left, I pushed myself so I could finish strong. As I ran as fast as I could, I told myself this was all the interval training was for, the last push. And a push it was, according to the pace chart on my Garmin my pace increased from 5:25 min/km to 4:20 min/km in the last 4 minutes of the race. With that, I crossed the finish line and once I realized that I clocked a sub-4 hour in my first marathon, my eyes were full of tears of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to keep moving after the finish line so I could meet my friends who were waiting outside the stadium but it became clear that I could walk only very slowly. After stretching a bit, having my bag retrieved from the bag drop and my medals engraved, we walked to nearby restaurant to have celebratory burgers and beers. But after that the challenge was to get home, as a lot of public transport access was closed due to the race which means that I need to walk to Amsterdam Zuid station. The distance is only 1,5 km but I was limping to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the next few days I was still limping but I forced myself to go for a walk everyday because I know it helped with recovery. I also wore compression socks when I went to sleep for almost a week after the race. It got better every day and I can finally walk up and down the stairs again on the weekend after the race. That being said, I took a complete rest from any sports activities in the first week after the race. I resumed doing sports when I rowed again on Monday (8 days after the race) and my first run back was exactly two weeks after the race. On to the next race!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Made with a new\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http://sfdavis.com/racereports/\"&gt;race report generator&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0created by &lt;a href=\"/u/herumph\"&gt;u/herumph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "941b9770-3f38-11e3-b90c-12313d18f999", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qlit", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0dd3bb", "id": "1gix7pv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "garlicsaucesucker", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/running/comments/1gix7pv/tcs_amsterdam_marathon_2024_my_first_marathon/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1gix7pv/tcs_amsterdam_marathon_2024_my_first_marathon/", "subreddit_subscribers": 3688140, "created_utc": 1730667872.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "running", "selftext": "Abbott just announced it: https://www.tcssydneymarathon.com", "author_fullname": "t2_g6pqz", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sydney Marathon is now a World Major Marathon.
