Use Case: 
As a doctor, we want to know the volume of each medication that is used per day, along with the ages of patients that it is being used for. We will use these results to better approximate how much medication needs to be ordered and what percentage is being given to each patient depending on age range. The results will quantitiavely be used to determine what age group and sex requires the most volume of medication. 

The real world impacts the complexity of code because if there are many components that we need to be aware of in our question and data collection periods, our code will have to be more comprehensive and inclusive of everything we have to take into account.
