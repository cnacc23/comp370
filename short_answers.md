Q1. A cloud machine is better than a laptop for data science work at scale because:
	- laptops have limited compute power and special hardware
	- laptops have limited storage 
	- laptops have poor proximity to other resources 
	- laptops are insecure (ie. could get lost, stolen) 

Q2. 

Question Definition; highlighting a question that has not been asked before that we want to learn from data. 

Data Collection; obtaining and arranging data so that it can be worked with. 

Data Annotation; applying features that will be used for analysis.  

Data Analysis; the creation of statistical models and visualization using existing methods on existing quatitative data

Interpretation; drawing conclusions to the question based on the data analysis. 

Communication; answering the question based on the results from the interpretation step.

Q3. Data analytics involves measuring already existing data to gain a new insight, while data science revolves around measuring things that haven't been measured before. 

Q4. If the question is not properly articulated, further steps such as data collection and data annotation may have to come to a halt and loop back to the question stage so that the project can succeed.
